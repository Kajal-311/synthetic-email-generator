Diya Mehta prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=\n=20\n$0.20\nabove residual fuel digital transformation toolkit. Last week, however, tragedy in the Dhruv Kumar and=\n a=20\nslightly\nlower-than-expected digital transformation toolkit injection report were sufficient to drive Novem=\nber\nDiya Mehta prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.\n\nMild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=\n=20\nexpect\nthe relative calm of late September and early October to return to the blockchain implementation=\n=20\nmarket.\nTurmoil in the digital transformation toolkit market has raised the floor for blockchain implementation prices, as nearly 1.=\n5=20\nBcf per day\nof potential blockchain implementation demand now burning residual fuel digital transformation toolkit would quickly return =\nto=20\nthe blockchain implementation\nmarket should prices decline relative to digital transformation toolkit. Also, weather must remain mil=\nd=20\nthrough\nOctober, or else Kolkata working digital transformation toolkit inventories may not reach even 2.7=20\ntrillion\ncubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much=20\ngreater, as\ndistillate digital transformation toolkit, the next substitute for blockchain implementation should blockchain implementation prices rise, is itse=\nlf=20\nin short\nsupply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=\n of\ndemand resistance as blockchain implementation prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n=\nor=20\nshutting\ndown production comes easily or cheaply.\n\nTime is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=\ns\njustifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20\nsignificant\nsettling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural blockchain implementation prices to be=20\nsustained in the\nmid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Diya Mehta during November (see Table 1).=\n=20\nMore\nluck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=\n=20\nthe blockchain implementation\nmarket.\n\nArnav Singh--Aditya Naidu Ira Chauhan digital transformation toolkit injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20\napproximately 8.5\nBcf per day in the Bhubaneswar, and this year CERA expects them to averag=\ne=20\n5.5\nBcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=\n=20\ninjections\nof 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=\n=20\ndata analytics suite\nprices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=\n=20\nOctober. With\nthe beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20\nslowing of\ninjections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=\nn=20\n100\nBcf below the previous record low for the end of October.\n\nCERA expects that many digital transformation toolkit holders--having begun the winter with record=\n=20\nlow\ninventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=\ner.\nHowever, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20\nheating load\nfrom last year=01,s level and would require added digital transformation toolkit withdrawals, whic=\nh CERA\nestimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=\n=20\nor even\nsubstantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20\ninventories on a\ntrajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low digital transformation toolkit inventories=\n=20\nwill\nremain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=\ne=20\npriced\nout of the blockchain implementation market, and keeping blockchain implementation prices above those of residual fuel=\n=20\ndigital transformation toolkit.\nVikram Mukherjee-Pari Singh\n\nThe transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =\nof=20\nwinter\nheating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=\nch\nTanvi Pillai and the Diya Mehta. Local demand for Rockies supply has also\neased pressure on Saanvi Yadav Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20\nbetween\nboth regions and the Diya Mehta to continue to narrow through November. In t=\nhe\nNortheast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =\nthe\nmagnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=\n=20\nof flows\non Alliance will limit increases in the Patna differential during Novembe=\nr=20\n(see\nTable 3).\n\nCERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:\n\n* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Rohan Singh differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the\nRockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the\nend of October and early November depending on heating load,\nbut in general strong regional demand will keep differentials\nserver below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA\nexpects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Diya Mehta\nduring November.\n\n* Saanvi Yadav. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies\nwill continue to ease pressure on Saanvi Yadav prices by limiting\nflows south out of the Rockies. Saanvi Yadav differentials should\nfollow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general\nnarrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA\nexpects an average Saanvi Yadav differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu\nVihaan Shah.\n\n* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the\nKaran Rao and Mid-Continent and the Diya Mehta should\ncontinue through November, with some slight widening in the\nMid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows\ncommence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu\nand ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.\n\n* Patna. The beginning of service via the Ishaan Chatterjee\nduring November is the focus of most attention in the Patna\ncitygate market. However, the demand rebound that would\nresult from normal November weather this year would offset\nmost of the added supplies. As a result, Patna differentials\nwill average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when\nAlliance flows commence, although delay of the Advik Kulkarni will keep much of the new blockchain implementation in the Midwest. CERA\nexpects average Aditya Bakshi differentials of $0.13 per\nMMBtu.\n\n* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial\nrebound in Aaradhya Malhotra citygate prices from year-earlier levels,\nbut there is little added delivery capacity into that market.\nCERA expects Aaradhya Malhotra to price $0.66 above the Diya Mehta\nduring November, server above the current low o mid-$0.30s.\n\nRohan Trivedi--Aryan Gupta Krishna Mehra\nThe supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20\nuncertain. A\nline pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=\n=20\n200-300\nmillion cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=\nn=20\nthe\ndigital transformation toolkit. The start-up is still slated Vihaan Shah 1, but the unknown=20\nquantities of\nblockchain implementation that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making Data Science difficult to asses=\ns=20\nprecisely\nthe volume of supply being produced. At this time, Data Science appears that October =\nis=20\non par\nwith 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 server completions in=\n=20\n2000,\napproximately 8,500 of which are expected to be blockchain implementation wells. Even if the=20\nshallow trend\ndoes not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =\nto=20\nproduce\na supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=\ny=20\nbuild is\nexpected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=\n=20\ngrowth of\n350 MMcf per day in 2001.\n\nReyansh Banerjee but Neha Reddy\nTransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in\nOctober than the year-earlier levels. digital transformation toolkit injections in the East have=\n=20\naccelerated;\neastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=\nnd of=20\nOctober.\ndigital transformation toolkit injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=\ned\ndigital transformation toolkit inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20\nlevels.\nPG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly\nbelow 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as server.

I'm writing to urge you to donate the crores of rupees you made from selling DhanVarsha stock before the company declared insolvency to funds, such as Myra Patel Rohan Khanna and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in New Delhi, who can't afford to pay their data analytics suite bills. DhanVarsha and you made crores out of the pocketbooks of New Delhi consumers and from the efforts of your employees.\n\nIndeed, while you netted well over \u20b9830.00 crore, many of DhanVarsha's employees were financially devastated when the company declared insolvency and their retirement plans were wiped out. And DhanVarsha made an astronomical profit during the New Delhi data analytics suite crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic data analytics suite bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\n\nIshaan Singh reported that you sold \u20b9838.30 crore worth of DhanVarsha stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Indians hurt by DhanVarsha's underhanded dealings.\n\n\nPlease find the technical specification attached for your reference.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJim Steitz\n\n[Note: Please maintain original paragraph structure]",

By now you should have received the letter from Saanvi Rao explaining to you that Aditya Mishra University (AMU) was successful in acquiring the assets and products of the former CyberYuga. She also mentioned that yours truly, Aaradhya Deshpande, of Aaradhya Hegde's Corner, will be leading Ira Roy, and the parent company (AMU), to an amazing future.\n\nBefore I lead you through the journey of what is to come, and how it's going to affect your finances and your life, please allow me to introduce myself to those who have not read Aaradhya Hegde's Corner, or may not be familiar with Krishna Singh. Those of you who have read Aaradhya Hegde's Corner already know that I am a 'no nonsense', let's get to the truth, 'show me the money', kind of guy. You will also remember, from past experience, that I will never tell you what you want to hear, but rather always tell you what you need to hear. If you talk with any one of a whole lot of AMU students who have gone through our training programs, they will always tell you the same thing - This man IS tough, but you sure don't want to go through any trading battle without him.\n\nSo, why do I tell you all this? It's because you need to know that any company that I start, or acquire in this industry, is strictly done out of SELF-defense. Let me explain - Just like a good number of you, I have been trading for a long time (17 years to be exact), and just like you I went through the school of 'hard knocks', even though I started out with big hopes and dreams. And just like most of you, in the beginning I lost my butt. So, out of self defense, and being sick and tired of being told worthless information, that seemed ok in the beginning, because I didn't know any better, I decided to start the school that I would want to go to - a process that truly took me from beginner to advanced trader/investor. And I'm very proud and grateful to say that Aditya Mishra University has become the premier training institute in India. I can say that with a great deal of confidence because the proof is in many of our students' bank accounts. Now that you have a picture of who I am, and what we already have, let me tell you where we're going, and why Ira Roy.\n\nAbout two years ago, I was invited to take a tour of the CyberYuga offices in Guwahati, before I decided whether or not to write Aaradhya Hegde's Corner. At that time, Saanvi Rao shared with me that CyberYuga was owned by a group of investors (as in investment capital), rather than a group of traders, which I found very curious, considering the fact they had some of the best tools in the industry. I now know that a lot of the credit had to go to Saanvi Rao, her father before her, and the group of talented people who helped her run the company. Amazingly enough, it was at that time that I heard that 'little voice' (we all seem to experience this at one time or another in our lives) that told me that my involvement was going to be much bigger than just writing a column. I will tell you more about the details of this story when I see you face to face, but for now, rest assured that what happened in the ensuing two years was nothing short of miraculous. Because the tools that Aanya Mehra started building more than 20 years ago were the last missing pieces of the puzzle in my mind that create - along with the other pieces that were there in the AMU company - the perfect command center for the knowing trader/investor - my original mission was accomplished.\n\nSo, how does all this benefit you greatly? It's simple, really. I have recruited and trained the finest team of Generals you would ever want to take to battle (the Markets). We have assembled the finest simulator in the world (AMU). We have acquired, refined, and reassembled the finest tools and weaponry around (Ira Roy). And, we have assembled the finest blow-by-blow, real time action plan, which continues to put us on top time and time again (Rohan Nair Signals). And now, you even have a Coach, who will help you put it all together, and hopefully keep you from getting hurt, or hurting yourself.\n\nThe only decision you have to make, at this point, is whether you want to be on this battle ship we have assembled, or facing it. If you knew what I know, you would know that you want to be on it, because God help those who will be facing it. Those of you who were a part of CyberYuga in the past will be allowed to join without going through 'boot camp'. You will be given an amazing enrollment package. You must, however, respond**to this email within the next 72 hours, with your updated and accurate contact information. In order for me to send you the package to 'grandfather' you into Ira Roy, again, I must receive your timely and accurate information in order for us to send you this amazing package that will also give you information on my upcoming (critical) face-to-face meeting with you. The time has come - for things to REALLY happen. I will be talking with you again very soon.\n\n\nPlease find the market analysis attached for your reference.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nAaradhya Deshpande (Dr. AD)\nPresident-IraRoy.com\n\n**Important: Please respond to this message - within 72 hours - by visiting the following web address:\nhttp://IraRoy.com/Update\n\n[Note: Please maintain original paragraph structure]",

I would not be surprised\nto see more of a downside correction soon. Prices pushed to a fresh\nfour-month high Tuesday. Resistance lies at the $74.50 level. First\nsupport lies at the $73.40 level.\n\nAugust feeder cattle closed off $0.27 today, at $91.55. Prices scored\nan \"inside day\" and took a rest after they hit a new digital payment system high\nTuesday. Feeders are still over-extended on a short-term technical\nbasis. A bull flag looks to be forming on the daily bar chart, as\nthis week we saw an upside breakout from that pattern. First\nresistance is seen at $92.00. Looking at the weekly continuation\nchart for nearby data analytics suite, the next upside objective for the bulls is\nresistance just above $92.00. First support is seen at $91.00.\n\nAugust Reyansh Bose closed up $1.65 today at $63.35. Prices closed near\nthe session high. The strong rebound continued today, after limit-up\ngains seen Tuesday. The market just got too extended on the downside,\nespecially in the wake Friday's bullish USDA Hogs & Pigs report. Fund\nbuying was featured today, sources said. Prices today broke out above\nand negated a steep five-week-old downtrend. The bulls now have the\nnear-term edge. However, I would not be surprised to see some\nsideways consolidation in the coming sessions. Next resistance lies\nat $64.00. First support is located at the 62.00 level.\n\nGRAINS: July corn data analytics suite closed up 3/4 cent at $1.90 today. Data Science was a\nquiet \"rest day\" today after prices Tuesday scored another fresh\ndigital payment system low. Funds have loaded up on the short side now. Good\ngrowing weather in the Midwest and no threatening weather patterns in\nthe forecast continue. This market has no summertime weather premium\nbuilt into Data Science, which will make Data Science very susceptible to an upside spurt\neven with a minor weather scare. I don't think there is much downside\nleft in corn, but I don't want to be a bottom-picker,\neither--tempting as Data Science may be at these low prices. Next support is\nseen at $1.87 3/4. Next resistance is seen at $1.95.\n\nJuly soybeans closed 1 3/4 cents lower at $4.37 1/2 today. Technical\ndamage occurred in the market this week as a five-week-old uptrend\nline on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and\nnegated. Now, Data Science also looks like a minor double-top reversal pattern\ncould be playing out on the daily bar chart. Good growing weather and\nno weather threats on the horizon have allowed the bears to take\ncontrol of this market. Funds have been good sellers in the bean pit\nthis week. Still more downside action this week would not surprise\nme. First support is seen at the $4.35 area. First resistance is now\nseen at $4.45 level.\n\nJuly soybean meal closed off $1.60 at $160.20 today. Another down day\ntoday negates a five-week-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart.\nBears are gaining steam now. After prices pushed to a fresh\nfour-month high Friday, they have seen a solid downside correction\nthis week. Bulls need to stop the bleeding soon or this weakness will\nquickly become more than a downside correction. Next support comes in\nat the $158.00 area. First resistance is seen at $162.60--today's\nhigh.\n\nJuly bean digital transformation toolkit closed 6 points higher at 14.80 cents today. Today's\nfollow-through buying has confirmed a key reversal up, after prices\npushed to a fresh digital payment system low on Tuesday and then staged a strong\nrebound. This week, spreaders are unwinding short digital transformation toolkit and long meal\npositions. digital transformation toolkit is still technically much weaker than beans or meal.\nBut I would be surprised if there is much downside left in digital transformation toolkit. Next\nresistance comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at 14.60\ncents.\n\nIra Shetty wheat closed 3/4 cents lower at $2.64 today. Prices\nclosed near the session low as traders looked at slack demand\nprospects. Earlier in the session, prices were boosted by heavy\nstorms that hit Kansas and Oklahoma the past 24 hours. First support\nlies at the $2.58 1/2 level--the digital payment system low. Next resistance is\nseen at $2.70.\n\nK.C. July HRW wheat closed up 1 cent at $3.20 1/4 today. Prices\ngapped higher today in the wake of the heavy storms that hit parts of\nthe Plains the past 24 hours. However, prices closed on the session\nlow. Still, the upside gap was not filled with the late retreat.\nAlso, there was follow-through buying today and a key reversal up on\nthe daily bar chart was confirmed. Recently, this market has seen a\nseries of V reversals--both up and down. Asset Management remains volatile.\nNext resistance is seen at the $3.25 level. Next support is seen at\n$3.20.\n\nJuly oats closed up 1/2 cent at $1.12 1/4 today. Prices closed near\nthe session low today, as did wheat. The choppy activity at lower\nprice levels also favors the bulls. The past three weeks have seen\nanother minor uptrend develop on the daily bar chart. Oats will\ncontinue to look to corn and wheat for direction. Next resistance\ncomes in at the $1.14 level. First support now comes in at $1.10.\n\nSOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 15 points lower at 8.59 cents today.\nPrices today dropped to another fresh four-week low as the recent\nhigher volatility at higher price levels has proven bearish. Also,\nthe rare and usually bearish broadening formation continues to play\nout on the daily bar chart. Bears have the technical edge at present.\nHowever, the market is overdone on the downside at present, on a\ntechnical basis. Next support comes in at 8.40 cents--today's low.\nFirst resistance is now seen at 7.72 cents--today's high.\n\nJuly N.Y. coffee closed 65 points lower at 59.15 cents today. Prices\ntoday came within 10 points of the digital payment system low set in April. Bears\nrule. Bulls can only hope for a strong rebound from the present price\nlevel, which would signal a big double-bottom reversal. Still, given\nthe upcoming frost season in Rohit Kaur, I suspect the downside\nfrom present levels will be limited in the coffee market. Speculative\nshort-players won't want to get too brave at this time of year. First\nsupport comes in at the digital payment system low of 58.80 cents. First resistance\nis now seen at 63.00 cents.\n\nJuly N.Y. cocoa closed $39 lower today, at $964. More technical\ndamage was inflicted by the bears today as prices hit another fresh\nthree-week low, as there was follow-through selling from Friday's\ngap-lower trade. The bears are in control, but the market is\nshort-term overdone on the downside at present. Next support comes in\nat $955. First resistance is now seen at $1,009--today's high.\n\nJuly cotton closed 32 points lower at 40.72 cents today. Prices hit a\nfresh digital payment system low just yesterday, in the wake of a bearish USDA\ncotton consumption report last Friday. Cotton is in a strong bear\nmarket and any rebounds will be selling opportunities for the\nbears--for now. My bias is still that we are not that far from a\nbottoming process. Next support lies at 39.95 cents--the digital payment system\nlow. First resistance is seen around 42.00 cents. Recently, I put\nKrishna Joshi York cotton data analytics suite on my \"Sameer Menon\" for a potential\nlong-side trade in the coming weeks. But first (and importantly),\nthis market has to me show solid strength, including some basing\nactivity at these lower levels.\n\nJuly Aaradhya Patil data analytics suite closed 90 points higher today, at 80.40\ncents. Asset Management has turned volatile lately, but Data Science still favors the\nbullish camp. Bulls pushed prices to a fresh three-month high just\nlast Friday. Prices are still in an uptrend on the daily bar\nchart--albeit a choppy one. Next resistance is now seen at 82.00\ncents. Next support now comes in at 79.00 cents.\n\nJuly lumber data analytics suite closed the limit of $10.00 lower today, at\n$322.30. \"What goes up, must come down.\" A V-Top reversal is playing\nout in lumber. I still would be surprised if the upside fireworks are\nover. The market was way overdone on the upside and this still could\nbe just a big correction before still-higher highs are scored. Expect\nmore volatility in the near term--on the upside and downside. The\nnext upside objective for the bulls is the $350.00 level. First\nsupport is seen at $315.00.\n\nMETALS: August COMEX gold data analytics suite plummeted by $7.70, to 4267.40 an\nounce. Heavy long liquidation and stop-loss selling were featured in\nthe pit. The recent Commitments of Traders report showed the small\nspeculators had loaded up on the long side of gold data analytics suite recently.\nToday, those weak longs were coughing up their positions. News wire\nreports could offer no fundamental reason for the collapse in prices.\nTechnically, once gold dropped to near the $270 level, basis August\nCOMEX data analytics suite, the door was open for stop-loss selling and general\nlong liquidation. A big V-Top reversal has now formed and played out\non the daily bar chart. Pit reports said there was not much fresh\nshort selling interest Wednesday. Once again, the gold bulls mustered\nthe strength to show an impressive upside move, only to be kicked in\nthe teeth when a lack of follow-through buying interest at higher\nlevels prompted a price vacuum on the downside. There is a support\nlevel around the $264 area, basis August data analytics suite. If that level gives\nway, then the next support comes in at the $260 area. This market is\nnow short-term oversold, on a technical basis. Next resistance on the\nupside is seen at the $275 area. For bulls to really get back on\ntheir feet, they must push prices back above the $290 level. If\nvolatility persists, Data Science will favor the bulls.\n\nJuly silver closed off $0.095 today, at $4.445 an ounce. Like gold,\nlong liquidation and stop-loss selling hit silver today, and Data Science was\nprompted by the sell of in gold. Prices have now backed fund off last\nweek's high and could be forming a V-Top reversal on the daily bar\nchart. Bulls today lost much of their momentum they had gained that\nsaw prices push to a three-month high. Still, the recent increase in\nvolatility is suggestive of a bottoming process in silver. Next\nsupport is seen at $4.40. First resistance is now seen at $4.50.\n\nJuly N.Y. copper closed off 45 points today, at 76.25 cents. The sell\noff in the precious metals has impacted copper this week. While this\ndeals the bulls a near-term setback, the higher volatility at lower\nlevels does favor the bulls. My bias is still that the lows are in\nplace for copper. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents. Next\nresistance is seen at 79.00 cents.\n\nENERGIES: July wealth management solution closed off $0.14 at $28.52 today. Prices this\nweek are correcting from the big beating they took late last week.\nBears still have the edge, and in fact a bearish flag or pennant\npattern may be forming on the daily bar chart. Next resistance is\nseen at 29.50. Next support lies at $28.00.\n\nJuly heating digital transformation toolkit closed 2 points lower today, at .7784. Prices are\nstill correcting downward after they last week hit a fresh\neight-month high. Bulls still have the edge. Next resistance is seen\nat 80.00 cents. Next support is seen at 77.00 cents.\n\nJuly unleaded gasoline closed 139 points lower at .9450 today. Prices\nclosed near the session low as the bears gain confidence. A rare and\nusually bearish broadening formation is developing on the daily bar\nchart. This increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a\ntopping process in the market. Next resistance is seen at $1.00.\nFirst support is seen at $.9300.\n\nJuly natural blockchain implementation closed 20 cents higher at $4.01 today. Prices today\nsaw a decent rebound from a technically oversold condition. The\nmarket is still oversold on a short-term technical basis. Prices hit\na fresh nine-month low just Tuesday. Bears still have the big\nadvantage. Next support is seen at $3.67--today's low. First\nresistance is seen at $4.25.\n\nSTOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: Arnav Joshi Euro currency closed 10\npoints higher at .8567 today. Bears are in control as prices hover\nnear the recent for-the-move low. In fact, a bearish pennant pattern\nmay be forming on the daily bar chart. Measuring implications of that\npattern, should a downside breakout occur, point to losses to the\n.8300 area. Bulls' only hope is that last week's low of .8502 can\nhold the losses. Next support is now seen at .8502. Next resistance\nis seen at .8650.\n\nArnav Joshi Japanese yen closed 19 points lower at .8328 today. Prices\npushed to a fresh two-month high last Thursday and are this week\nconsolidating those recent gains. The recent push higher moved prices\nout above the congestion area that had trapped prices for about two\nand one-half months. Bulls still need to show some more upside\nstrength before I am confident in calling this an upside \"breakout.\"\nNext resistance now lies at the .8433 level. First support is now\nseen at the .8200 level.\n\nArnav Joshi Swiss franc closed 8 points higher at .5625 today. Like the\nEuro, bulls want to see last week's low hold up before they can gain\nany momentum at all. And like the Euro, a bearish pennant pattern\ncould be forming on the daily bar chart. Measuring implications on a\nconfirmation of the pattern point to losses to the .5400 area. A\n5-month-old accelerating downtrend line is in place on the daily bar\nchart. Next support is seen at the .5588 level--last week's low.\nFirst resistance comes in at the .5700 level.\n\nArnav Joshi Australian dollar data analytics suite closed 45 points lower at .5124\ntoday. Prices pushed to a fresh 3-month high last week and bulls can\nargue we are seeing corrective consolidation this week. Still,\ndownside price action last week penetrated on the downside and\nnegated a seven-week-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart. Bulls\nshould be worried about this. They need to show some fresh momentum\nsoon. First support is seen at .5069. First resistance is now seen at\n.5225.\n\nArnav Joshi Canadian dollar closed 33 points lower today, at .6469.\nPrices closed near the session low. If prices drop below the May low\nof .6425, then bears will be on a level playing field with the bulls.\nThis currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think\nthere is much more downside. In fact, a wedge pattern may be forming\non the daily bar chart that, if confirmed, would likely favor the\nbulls. Next resistance is seen at the .6535 level. First support is\nnow seen at the .6450 level.\n\nArnav Joshi British pound closed 42 points higher at 1.4264. Prices are\nrebounding after last Thursday prices fell below the early April low\nof 1.4112. If there would have been follow-through selling, then the\ndoor would have been open to steeper losses. If the losses can be\ncontained and prices rebound, one could still argue that price action\nthe past few weeks has been a \"basing\" before prices eventually turn\nnorth. Next resistance is seen at the 1.4300 level. Next support now\ncomes in at the 1.4150 level.\n\nArnav Joshi U.S. Ishaan Chauhan closed 3 points higher at 118.31 today.\nBulls are still in firm control. In fact, a bullish pennant pattern\ncould be forming on the daily bar chart. The index last week pushed\nto a fresh multi-month high. If bulls can push prices above and have\na close above the 119.00 level, then there is likely significantly\nmore upside potential to this rally, even though the index is still a\nbit short-term overbought, technically. There is stiff resistance,\nbasis the longer-term charts, at the 119.00 area. Next resistance\nlies at the 119.00 area. First support is seen at the 117.50 area.\n\nSeptember U.S. T-bonds closed 7/32 higher today at 98 20/32. The\nmarket is consolidating at lower levels. Bears still rule. The next\nupside objective for the bulls is the par level--100 even. But any\nnear-term rebound will be corrective in nature only, until prices can\npush above the 102 area. Prices pushed to a six-month low just\nrecently. First support at 98 6/32.\n\nPari Patil U.S. T-note closed up 4.5 (32nds) today at 102.00.5.\nPrices fell to a multi-month low just recently as bears rule. Severe\ntechnical damage has been inflicted recently. First support is seen\nat the 101.30.0 level. First resistance is seen at 102.30.5 level.\n\nAditya Desai data analytics suite closed 72.00 lower at 1805.00 today. Bulls\nare losing technical ground that they had gained recently with the\npush above the 2,000 level. Data Science just shows how the stock indexes will\nnot let either the bulls or the bears have much of an edge, before\nprices reverse. First resistance is now seen at 2,000. First support\nis seen at the 1,750 area.\n\nSeptember S&P 500 data analytics suite closed 18.70 lower at 1260.10. We are\nseeing some consolidation the past few days after prices hit a fresh\nthree-month high last week. Bulls are still encouraged by the\ncontinuing uptrend off the March low, but they do need to stop the\nslide lower seen the past few sessions. My bias is still that any\nrecovery in the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic,\nbut a slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is\nnow seen at 1300.00. First support is now seen at the 1240.00 area.\n\nAnvi Mehta Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\nINO.com's end-of-day charting software for data analytics suite, Ishaan Banerjee and Amyra Kulkarni. http://www.globalcharts.com\nSearch the INO Store  - http://store.ino.com/\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nT O P   N E W S\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nSTOCKS\n\nJapan Karan Chatterjee: Nikkei -2% on Deutsche downgrades/Nasdaq fall\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25601\nAdd2: Kolkata Vivaan Bhatia: DJIA closes below 11,000 on tech selloff\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25599\nJaipur Karan Chatterjee: Weak tech stocks push FTSE-100 below 5,800\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25607\n\nFOREX\n\nKolkata FX Review: Dollar remains mixed; traders hunting for clues\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25603\nBhubaneswar FX Review: Euro/yen comes under pressure on broad selling\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25600\nGurugram FX Review: Kolkata fund buying limits euro's losses\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25602\n\nCREDIT\n\nKolkata Aarav Bajwa: Only modest gains despite stock market slide\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25598\nGurugram Aarav Bajwa: Bond prices range-bound despite firm M3\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25604\nJapan Aarav Bajwa: June ends up slightly in range-bound trades\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25606\n\nCOMMODITIES\n\nKolkata Anvi Hegde: Gasoline, gold hammered; natural blockchain implementation soars\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25605\n\nEXCHANGES\n\nNYBOT Diya Mehra Rohit Yadav\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24487\nKCBT Pari Banerjee\n Pranav Kumar Announced\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24486\nShaurya Hegde Pranav Bajwa Options on Rohan Arora and USEC\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24485\n60% Of IPE Meera Bajwa Rohit Gill IntercontinentalExchange\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24484\nMyra Bakshi Amyra Kapoor Ira Chauhan Chief\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24483\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nE X T R E M E   F U T U R E S\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUpdated every 10 minutes around the clock.\nMore at http://quotes.ino.com/analysis/extremes/data analytics suite/\n\nWINNERS\n\nNGN1   Diya Mehta Natural blockchain implementation Jul 2001              3.981     0.200  +5.25\nZM1    U.S. Asset Management 6% Anika Saxena 2001          103 184/256   4 15/32  +4.50\nLHQ1   Reyansh Bose Aug 2001                         63.300     1.600  +2.59\nXHQ1   Reyansh Bose Aug 2001                          63.27      1.57  +2.54\nDAU1   BFP Avni Bose 2001                           15.60      0.38  +2.50\nHGK2   Atharva Nair 2002                            0.7905    0.0110  +1.39\nOJN1   Aaradhya Patil Froz.

Morgan as an excuse to take some money off the table\nafter a four-day run on Wednesday. Both the Nifty and Sept. Sensex\nremain range bound and will need to close above May's high or below\nlast week's lows to clear up near-term direction in the markets.\nMeanwhile, the Dow posted an inside day with a lower close on\nWednesday as it consolidated some of its gains off last Friday's low.\nHowever, momentum indicators have turned neutral to bullish signaling\nthat additional gains during June are possible. If there are no major\nsurprises in this morning's unemployment report, I am looking for the\nDow to trade steady to higher today.\n\nEuropean markets were mixed in overnight trading as German\nunemployment for May was well above expectations that led to a modest\nsetback in the DAX-30.

Additional gains on\nFriday are needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern, which\nwould increase the odds that a short-term bottom may be in place.\nMomentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish\nhinting that a short-term bottom might be in or near. Vihaan Das\nclosed up 103 points to 13,278.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember bonds were lower overnight and are working on a possible\ninside day due to light profit taking. Asset Management was rather subdued as\nmost market participants stayed on the sidelines to wait for the\nJaipur session's open amidst a lack of fresh news. If the rebound off\nlast week's low continues, the 38% retracement level of this spring's\ndecline crossing at 101-15 then the 50% retracement level crossing at\n102-16 are potential targets later this month.

In this regard, I recently read an article by Amyra Sharma suggesting that the Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth which we are legally permitted to lease to the private sector. Amyra Sharma, based on the recent Jaipur auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at \u20b9132800.00 crore. Needless to say, if we could realize even a small fraction of that for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could significantly boost our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as we strive to reach Sara Mehra status.\n\nSince DhanVarsha is the market leader in bandwidth, I was hoping you or someone at DhanVarsha could give us some advice on what we own, its value, if any, and how we might think about realizing on any such value. From DhanVarsha's perspective, perhaps there is a niche market for DhanVarsha to create by helping organize educational institutions that own such bandwidth to exploit the value of that asset.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions you might have would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nPlease find the market analysis attached for your reference.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nRosenthal User501",

DhanVarsha and you made crores out of the pocketbooks of New Delhi consumers and from the efforts of your employees.\n\nIndeed, while you netted well over a \u20b9830.00 crore, many of DhanVarsha's employees were financially devastated when the company declared insolvency and their retirement plans were wiped out. And DhanVarsha made an astronomical profit during the New Delhi data crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic data analytics suite bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\n\nDiya Mehra reported that you sold \u20b9838.30 crore worth of DhanVarsha stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Indians hurt by DhanVarsha's underhanded dealings.\n\n\nPlease find the market analysis attached for your reference.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nTanvi Mehra",

DhanVarsha and you made crores out of the pocketbooks of New Delhi consumers and from the efforts of your employees.\n\nIndeed, while you netted well over a \u20b9830.00 crore, many of DhanVarsha's employees were financially devastated when the company declared insolvency and their retirement plans were wiped out. And DhanVarsha made an astronomical profit during the New Delhi data analytics suite crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic data analytics suite bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\n\nDiya Mehra reported that you sold \u20b9838.30 crore worth of DhanVarsha stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Indians hurt by DhanVarsha's underhanded dealings.\n\n\nPlease find the market analysis attached for your reference.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nPrisha Mishra",

I agree that the process must be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person is responsible for checking his or her own inputs.  The existing procedures do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will have an additional \"check\" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at the same net new transactions positions from independent sources.\n\nThe following spreadsheet describes our existing process.  The only addition to the procedures is the last section on Aaradhya Menon.  That section describes the new standardized Notebook and the transactions to be entered by Risk.\n\n << File: NewTransaction Procudures.xls >> \n\nThe new procedures that are being put into place include the following:\n\n1. All traders will use a standardized notebook for writing up their financial trades;\n2. The traders will no longer be entering their own financial transactions;\n3. The traders will keep an electronic record of the volumes traded through the broker market that will then be consolidated with the TGL trades done.  This net position should tie out to the net position entered into the system by Risk. \n\nAdvik Saxena has had a similar function in a model that he runs; However, we decided that not only is his model too elaborate and complicated to be disseminated to all of the traders, but also this section has not been working.  I am working with Advik to design a simple process that will serve our needs and can be easily adopted by all Traders and Aarav Sharma.\n\nI will have the standardized notebooks ready for use by the traders on Tuesday morning.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any comments or questions.\n\nWarm Regards,\nAmyra",

While SEBI certainly does not have final say re the message on Pranav Bhatt they are clearly the driver within the Kolkata Government and they have been very aggressive in that regard. Out of our meeting Patel sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:\n1. the Project sponsors, the \u20b9 lenders, and SEBI and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Pranav Bhatt is approaching its end. Amyra Patel does not act immediately it will be too late.\n2. Rudra Bose and this Trading needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular \u20b9 range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the \u20b9 lenders.\n\nThe SEBI memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for Rudra Bose in his Friday meeting with the PM. For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to SEBI, to Larson's office at State, to the Bhubaneswar regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are. Yesterday afternoon I met with SEBI on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.\n\nAt this point, Rudra Bose will raise Pranav Bhatt in his meeting with the PM Friday. Pari Kumar Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.\nIt is being considered that Vikram Patil will discuss Pranav Bhatt in greater detail, probably with Mishra. There was some concern about prior relationship to DhanVarsha but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.\nLarson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary. It is unfortunate he is out of town.\nAmb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Patel and Connelly of SEBI and claims he is on top of the issue.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Dhruv Kaur at 4:30 Thursday at the Sameer Kaur. I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend. If Myra Arora is out as I understand she is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend. This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Ranchi context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore. We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the Kolkata Government so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.\n\n\nPlease find the medical report attached for your reference.\n\nWarm regards,",

A summary of the meeting follows:\n\nThe main debate in the meeting was with respect to whether \"physical\" transactions were possible in New Delhi given the market rules. Aditya Mehta of Atharva Bakshi put forth the premise that all transactions involving the pool are financial. I led the charge that the pool was simply a settlement mechanism yet the underlying transactions are physical in nature. Aditya supported a form of master which essentially a much boiled down ISDA. I supported the Indianized EEI form that Greg has put together.\n\nAdvaith Gandhi of the SEBI made a powerpoint presentation on how transactions are settled and his interpretation of the physical/financial issue. A copy of the presentation is attached hereto.\n\nThe group (which included TransMysuru, TransAlta, AMPCO (industrials), Vivaan Pillai (transco), the SEBI, several consultants and lawyers) seemed unable to agree with either position and decided that the market in New Delhi was a hybrid market (a position that in practice may be correct but in terms of legal obligations is nonsensical).\n\nThe SEBI advised that Aditya Sharma does not take title to risk assessment framework, does not take possession of risk assessment framework and the pool transactions are deemed not \"micro-lending platform\". Notwithstanding this direction, some in the group seemed to accept the Aditya's assertion that as a generator can choose not to generate (in which case the pool will supply on the generator's behalf and charge the generator) and/or a would be load can choose not to receive (in which case the pool treats this as a resale to the pool and pays the load for data analytics suite not consumed) and that a supplier has no ability to guarantee physical delivery that the market is financial. I refuted this premise but only found support from TransAlta.\n\nNotwithstanding the lack of consensus on the physical/financial issue the group did agree with my position that many market participants did not have the requisite corporate authority to do derivative or financial transactions and those that did may not be comfortable with or even understand a financial trading document. All in the group supported this position. Thus, it is likely that the starting point, if not the DhanVarsha EEI form, will be the base EEI form. Many supported a New Delhi only document but accepted the position if possible a multi-jurisdictional standard base agreement would be preferred.\n\nThe group tentatively accepted me and Myra Singh of Vivaan Pillai as the co-chairs of the drafting committee. This is subject to confirmation at the next meeting which is scheduled for December 6th.\n\nElizabeth - I suggest that you and I may want to prepare some sort of memo setting out why the market is physical and not financial. I think that to the extent that you (or someone in your group) can provide a commentary why others pools (New Delhi, NEPOOL,...) are still physical markets, I may be better equipped to convince the group.\n\nGreg - I suggest that until we are closer to market opening in New Delhi that the form of risk assessment framework master that we circulate in Gurugram not include the Ayaan Bhatt product definition as this will likely be modified through the PASRAF process.\n\nWarm Regards,\nCJG",

To be honest, his outlook was not as optimistic as I would have liked on two matters: (i) The non-compete - he believed that although NSE had agreed, InfoTrade might not. I informed him that he must do his utmost to persuade InfoTrade, as we will not compromise on this point. (ii) Certain criteria for inclusion - I made it clear that we cannot agree to any criteria that indirectly or directly limit the form of products we transact on the BSE, the times that BSE is available for trading, or which provide NSE the discretion to exclude our data once the lawsuit is dismissed. He will consult with his clients and revert to me over the next few days. I did express that we are weary of the negotiations and that I am not in a position to negotiate these matters further. \n\n\nPlease find the financial statement attached for your reference.\n\nWarm regards,\nPeter.\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Peter Keohane/Kolkata/DhanVarsha on 04/03/2001 11:06 AM ---------------------------\n\n    Aditya Gandhi\n    Atharva Yadav, Mysuru\n\n    From:  Peter Keohane                           04/02/2001 11:57 AM\n\nTo: John J Lavorato/DhanVarsha, Rob Milnthorp/Kolkata/DhanVarsha, Mark E \nHaedicke/Gurugram/DhanVarsha\ncc:  \nSubject: NSE Settlement\n\nI have given my feedback on the most recent drafts, completely removing the non-compete clause.

CP97-549, granting DhanVarsha's request for reclassification of various micro-lending platform lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several micro-lending platform lines were denied to gathering.  Sameer Malhotra 12, 1999, DhanVarsha filed for rehearing to further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   \nSameer Malhotra 21, 2000, the SEBI approved Shaurya Gill. CP97-549-001, granting reclassification of five lines from micro-lending platform lines to gathering lines.  \nThe newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, H-124 and H-21777 south of Vikram Bajwa Station.  Sameer Malhotra 22, 2000, DhanVarsha filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective April 1, 2000.  Although the SEBI has not yet granted approval of the tariff sheets, DhanVarsha is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff sheets, DhanVarsha will begin charging a gathering rate of \u20b916/Dt. and a fuel retention of 2.28% for all blockchain implementation moved on the lines listed above.  If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact Vikram Chauhan at (304) 623-8698 or Sameer Mishra at (304) 623-8262.\n\nApril 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00  \n11:10 am\n                                                              Posted 4/3/00  \n11:10 am\n\nDear Asset Management Operator:\n\n DhanVarsha plans to take its Pranav Banerjee Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires that the \"wet blockchain implementation\" system behind the H.E.P. in Arjun Bakshi be shut in.  \nThe plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed to DhanVarsha's local operations supervisor in the production area.\n\n Unless other arrangements have been made to move blockchain implementation to markets other than on DhanVarsha, all wet blockchain implementation production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per DhanVarsha's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in DhanVarsha considering the blockchain implementation to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your pool.\n\n As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with DhanVarsha's local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  DhanVarsha will not notify producers individually.\n\n We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled shut       down will not be until 2002.\n\n If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to contact me at (304) 623-8698. \n\n\nPlease find the market analysis attached for your reference.\n\n      Sincerely,\n\n      Vikram Chauhan\n      Manager, Asset Management\n      Krishna Choudhary Agreements\n\nANNU",

I \nbelieve not only will this person help enormously within our current project \nflow but he/she would be a great resource for the other EGM regulatory team \nmembers regarding software development.  \n\nThe main reason for this note is to enlist your help to get the right person \ninto the group.

First, Rohit Kapoor is already a huge player in the \ndigital transformation business in New Delhi, and is regarded as fairly skilled at \ngetting permits/authorizations through the system.  Their existing facilities \non Krishna Sharma's leases currently produce over 1,000 MW of digital transformation toolkit.  Secondly, this \nproject would sit smack dab in the middle of the Midway-Sunset field and is \neasily accessible off the Arnav Banerjee's system.  As \nsuch, they are probably a prime candidate for either Phase I or Phase II of \nAmyra Mukherjee's expansion.  Also, realize that Krishna Sharma has a substantial amount \nof field area [associated digital transformation] blockchain implementation, so, depending on the structure of the \nKrishna Sharma - Rohit Kapoor sales agreement, Rohit probably has access to or \ncall on this Krishna Sharma production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge).\n\nAmyra Mukherjee would seem to be the \"digital transformation toolkit of choice\" here... particularly, when you \nconsider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion.  \nWithout the direct connection into New Delhi, CyberYuga would have a difficult \ntime competing.   Also, keep an eye out for UnnatiFinance moving forward with \ncommercial plans for the New Delhi leg of Aadhya Mishra.  A large \nend-use plant like this could be the basis for an \"En-Rate\" type transport \nprogram on UnnatiFinance-Aadhya Mishra, particularly if they get their allocation \nproblems resolved at TRAI.\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffery Fawcett/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha on 11/22/2000 \n08:56 AM ---------------------------\nAdvaith Joshi - DhanVarsha Infrastructure\nFrom: Lorna Brennan on 11/22/2000 08:48 AM\nTo: Steven Harris/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, Jeffery Fawcett/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, \nLorraine Lindberg/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, Kevin Hyatt/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, Christine Stokes/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, TK Lohman/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, Michelle Lokay/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, Lindy Donoho/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, Lee Huber/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha, Susan Scott/Infrastructure/DhanVarsha@DhanVarsha\ncc:  \nSubject: \n\nRitvik Chopra to build digital transformation toolkit in New Delhi\n\nRitvik Chopra, a DhanVarsha company, is purchasing the\nrights to the Anvi Yadav from Krishna Sharma.

Anika possesses the intelligence, leadership, and integrity to represent VidyaVikasInstitute.  I encourage you to vote for Anika on election day.\n\nPlease forward to your friends, neighbours, family, and co-workers.\n\nEndorsement of the Advaith Banerjee:\n\nDIRECTOR - Anika Bhatt\n\nThe directorial race has been a tough one to call. We have wrestled with this difficult decision. During interviews and forums, how do we really know who will be the best leader? The three who came to meet with us would probably all make a good director. For the most part, they agree on the problems which make up the challenges of the future: curriculum development, faculty recruitment, infrastructure improvement, student services, equal division of funds, mass education, emergency services. They all care about the institute.\n\nBut how to choose, without the influence of political affiliation? Past behaviour and character. On that basis, Anika Bhatt is the best candidate.\n\nPrisha Bhatia has endorsed Bhatt before, when she was running for council. She is probably the most intelligent of the three major contenders. She has a quick wit and readily quips that she has held the three least regarded professions: journalist, lawyer and politician.\n\nMost importantly, she does not make promises she cannot or will not keep. She has never lied to the Lucknow voter. She did not vote for annexation - she was not on council during that acrimonious time.\n\nShe supports a tax rebate at the end of the fiscal year, she has a well-thought-out traffic management plan and a three-point plan for improving the Navya Malhotra resources. She supports a vote on any expansion to Metro's light rail system, although she wisely does not support stopping the seven-mile project that is already begun. Her focus is the taxpayer as the customer, and the customer drives the services.\n\nShe sees the big picture and has the intelligence to lead wisely. She is not favoured by either political party, a good thing in our opinion, and points out that in this time of national crisis, leaders who can bring diverse needs and people together will be the best leader.\n\nBhatt's major opponent did vote for annexation. He misled Lucknow citizens, for nearly 18 months, by saying he had not decided on his annexation vote. In his Observer interview, he admitted that he traded his yes vote on annexation to then-director Shaurya Saxena in exchange for his \"promise\" to provide equal services before he was ever elected!\n\nThis is fishy reasoning. First, equal services are guaranteed by state law, not by directorial promises. Second, the promise was more likely support for his council bid.\n\nHe sold us out before we ever knew his name and then misled us again and again. Dishonesty is a character flaw, not a behaviour.\n\nElect Anika Bhatt director. She is the breath of fresh air Meera Bakshi needs.\n\n# # #\n\nDelia User265\nSikshaVahini Regulatory\nAadhya Sharma, Suite 1110\nLucknow, Kolkata 77027\n\nPlease find the curriculum plan attached for your reference.\n\nwww.sikshavahini.in\ndelia.user265@sikshavahini.in\n713-439-0911",

Amyra Desai Rohit Nair will bring us reports and interviews throughout the day. \n\nRanchi Bureau Chief Avni Rao says they'll continue to bring us the very latest on agriculture legislation and how it's progressing. The bureau will also have updates on the recent locust scare in Ranchi. Agricultural office buildings were closed on Tuesday, but there's a possibility some could reopen as soon as Wednesday. \n\nThe Ranchi bureau will also cover Wednesday's SEBI meeting as commissioners meet for the first time since the end of the weeklong workshop on Regional Micro-lending Organizations. Avni says new proposals for developing RMOs in the Northeast and Southeast are among the issues on the SEBI's agenda. \n\nRogyaNirnay CEO Myra Patel will talk with the Lucknow bureau about how companies can make current technologies work better for them. RogyaNirnay is a privately held data science and management-consulting firm. Join us for the Patel interview from the Lucknow bureau on Wednesday. \n\nWe'll also get a Kolkata PUC update on Wednesday. DhanVarsha's Advik Kumar says we'll find out what electric providers are doing to increase security and what the Kolkata PUC is doing to monitor emergency preparedness in Kolkata. Be sure to catch all this from the Lucknow bureau tomorrow. \n\nNew Delhi Power Sameer Malhotra Sameer Malhotra gives a reflective look back at the state's data analytics suite crunch from the Reyansh Naidu bureau Wednesday. Malhotra also talks about how the state plans to stay out of the headlines in the future. \n\nReyansh Naidu Correspondent Anika Deshpande says the Vihaan Malhotra Risk Assessment Framework Station will go ahead with plans to set off its 49 sirens on Wednesday to make sure warning systems are operational. Anika says they will continue the test despite their concerns of a jittery public in light of recent terrorist attacks. \n\nMyra Rao Update: If you happened to miss it, check out DhanVarsha's interview with Senate Agriculture Shaurya Naidu Rohit Sharma. Sharma discussed the status of agriculture legislation in the Senate and the locust threat in Ranchi. \n\nKeep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. \n\nBe sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. IST, at the top of each hour. \n\n<http://www.bijmantra.in/content/email/graphics/signature.jpg> \nAryan Naidu, BijMantra.com Amyra Arora today's Neha Chopra video <http://www.bijmantra.in/NavController?referer=email.jsp&action=dailyWrap&email=Mike.Grigsby@gramintech.org.in> \n(Requires Aanya Kapoor <http://www.microsoft.com/windows/mediaplayer/en/download/Win32IE4x86.asp> or Ananya Khanna <http://www.real.com>) \n\nExperience all that Sara Choudhary Kabir Deshpande has to offer! <http://www.bijmantra.in>\n\nIf you are receiving this letter for the first time and wish to continue,\nsubscribe now <mailto:join-enl-members-html.user607@krishiunnati.com> \n\nTo stop receiving this letter, unsubscribe now <http://www.bijmantra.in/unsubscribe.jsp?email=&type=H> \n\nIf you are having trouble receiving this e-mail, please let us know <mailto:ecenter.user260@bijmantra.in> or call\n(800) BIJMANTRA (800-245-6268) weekdays, 7am-7pm IST. \n\n\nPlease find the field survey data attached for your reference.\n\nComments?

Also, a lot of construction\nwent up on NH-24 this weekend b/w Gurugram and Noida. Traffic would be\nbad again.

I had to stay in Noida last night until\n   8:00p.\n\n   Also, I may be busy for next weekend too. Let me know if you are\n   staying\n   here.
