American Gas Team\nE-Mail Category: Alert\nProduct Line: North American Gas ,\nURL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=3D5526&m=3D1390 ,\n\nAlternative URL:=20\nhttp://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/101600_16/nag_alt_101600_16_ab.html\n*********************************************************\n\nThe nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20\nsurface during\nthe relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=\nst=20\nweek.\nFrom mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=\non=20\nof\nmild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=\n=20\nand a lack\nof storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market\nsomewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=\n=20\n$0.20\nabove residual fuel oil. Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and=\n a=20\nslightly\nlower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem=\nber\nHenry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.\n\nMild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=\n=20\nexpect\nthe relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=\n=20\nmarket.\nTurmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=\n5=20\nBcf per day\nof potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return =\nto=20\nthe gas\nmarket should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil=\nd=20\nthrough\nOctober, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20\ntrillion\ncubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much=20\ngreater, as\ndistillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse=\nlf=20\nin short\nsupply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=\n of\ndemand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n=\nor=20\nshutting\ndown production comes easily or cheaply.\n\nTime is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=\ns\njustifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20\nsignificant\nsettling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20\nsustained in the\nmid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=\n=20\nMore\nluck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=\n=20\nthe gas\nmarket.\n\nGas Storage--The Final Push\nOctober storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20\napproximately 8.5\nBcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=\ne=20\n5.5\nBcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=\n=20\ninjections\nof 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=\n=20\nfutures\nprices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=\n=20\nOctober. With\nthe beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20\nslowing of\ninjections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=\nn=20\n100\nBcf below the previous record low for the end of October.\n\nCERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=\n=20\nlow\ninventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=\ner.\nHowever, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20\nheating load\nfrom last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=\nh CERA\nestimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=\n=20\nor even\nsubstantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20\ninventories on a\ntrajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=\n=20\nwill\nremain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=\ne=20\npriced\nout of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=\n=20\noil.\nRegional Markets-Winter Rules\n\nThe transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =\nof=20\nwinter\nheating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=\nch\nRocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also\neased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20\nbetween\nboth regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=\nhe\nNortheast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =\nthe\nmagnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=\n=20\nof flows\non Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=\nr=20\n(see\nTable 3).\n\nCERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:\n\n* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry\nHub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the\nRockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the\nend of October and early November depending on heating load,\nbut in general strong regional demand will keep differentials\nwell below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA\nexpects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub\nduring November.\n\n* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies\nwill continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting\nflows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should\nfollow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general\nnarrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA\nexpects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu\nfor November.\n\n* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the\nPermian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should\ncontinue through November, with some slight widening in the\nMid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows\ncommence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu\nand ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.\n\n* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline\nduring November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago\ncitygate market. However, the demand rebound that would\nresult from normal November weather this year would offset\nmost of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials\nwill average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when\nAlliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector\nPipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA\nexpects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per\nMMBtu.\n\n* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial\nrebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,\nbut there is little added delivery capacity into that market.\nCERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub\nduring November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.\n\nCanadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain\nThe supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20\nuncertain. A\nline pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=\n=20\n200-300\nmillion cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=\nn=20\nthe\npipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20\nquantities of\ngas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=\ns=20\nprecisely\nthe volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =\nis=20\non par\nwith 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=\n=20\n2000,\napproximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20\nshallow trend\ndoes not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =\nto=20\nproduce\na supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=\ny=20\nbuild is\nexpected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=\n=20\ngrowth of\n350 MMcf per day in 2001.\n\nDemand Slow but Exports Up\nTransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in\nOctober than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=\n=20\naccelerated;\neastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=\nnd of=20\nOctober.\nStorage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=\ned\nstorage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20\nlevels.\nPG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly\nbelow 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=\ner\nPipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=\nd=20\nto be\nslightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=\ned\nwestern Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=\n=20\nCanadian\ndemand.\n\nHigh Prices, Wide Differentials\nThe AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low\nUS$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20\nOctober.\nFor November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=\nng=20\nAECO\naverage of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).\n\n**end**\n\nFollow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables.\n\n*********************************************************\nCERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at=\n=20\nhttp://www.cera.com/event\n*********************************************************\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nAccount Changes\nTo edit your personal account information, including your e-mail\naddress, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm\n\nThis electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information\nfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

The headroom for price is much=20\ngreater, as\ndistillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse=\nlf=20\nin short\nsupply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=\n of\ndemand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n=\nor=20\nshutting\ndown production comes easily or cheaply.\n\nTime is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=\ns\njustifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20\nsignificant\nsettling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20\nsustained in the\nmid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=\n=20\nMore\nluck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=\n=20\nthe gas\nmarket.\n\nGas Storage--The Final Push\nOctober storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20\napproximately 8.5\nBcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=\ne=20\n5.5\nBcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=\n=20\ninjections\nof 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=\n=20\nfutures\nprices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=\n=20\nOctober. With\nthe beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20\nslowing of\ninjections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=\nn=20\n100\nBcf below the previous record low for the end of October.\n\nCERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=\n=20\nlow\ninventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=\ner.\nHowever, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20\nheating load\nfrom last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=\nh CERA\nestimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=\n=20\nor even\nsubstantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20\ninventories on a\ntrajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=\n=20\nwill\nremain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=\ne=20\npriced\nout of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=\n=20\noil.\nRegional Markets-Winter Rules\n\nThe transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =\nof=20\nwinter\nheating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=\nch\nRocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also\neased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20\nbetween\nboth regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=\nhe\nNortheast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =\nthe\nmagnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=\n=20\nof flows\non Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=\nr=20\n(see\nTable 3).\n\nCERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:\n\n* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry\nHub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the\nRockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the\nend of October and early November depending on heating load,\nbut in general strong regional demand will keep differentials\nwell below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA\nexpects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub\nduring November.\n\n* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies\nwill continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting\nflows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should\nfollow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general\nnarrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA\nexpects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu\nfor November.\n\n* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the\nPermian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should\ncontinue through November, with some slight widening in the\nMid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows\ncommence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu\nand ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.\n\n* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline\nduring November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago\ncitygate market. However, the demand rebound that would\nresult from normal November weather this year would offset\nmost of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials\nwill average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when\nAlliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector\nPipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA\nexpects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per\nMMBtu.\n\n* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial\nrebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,\nbut there is little added delivery capacity into that market.\nCERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub\nduring November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.\n\nCanadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain\nThe supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20\nuncertain. A\nline pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=\n=20\n200-300\nmillion cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=\nn=20\nthe\npipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20\nquantities of\ngas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=\ns=20\nprecisely\nthe volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =\nis=20\non par\nwith 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=\n=20\n2000,\napproximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20\nshallow trend\ndoes not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =\nto=20\nproduce\na supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=\ny=20\nbuild is\nexpected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=\n=20\ngrowth of\n350 MMcf per day in 2001.\n\nDemand Slow but Exports Up\nTransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in\nOctober than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=\n=20\naccelerated;\neastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=\nnd of=20\nOctober.\nStorage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=\ned\nstorage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20\nlevels.\nPG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly\nbelow 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=\ner\nPipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=\nd=20\nto be\nslightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=\ned\nwestern Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=\n=20\nCanadian\ndemand.\n\nHigh Prices, Wide Differentials\nThe AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low\nUS$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20\nOctober.\nFor November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=\nng=20\nAECO\naverage of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).\n\n**end**\n\nFollow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables.\n\n*********************************************************\nCERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at=\n=20\nhttp://www.cera.com/event\n*********************************************************\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nAccount Changes\nTo edit your personal account information, including your e-mail\naddress, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm\n\nThis electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information\nfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

By now you should have=\n received  the letter from Nick Van Nice explaining to you that Trader Tech=\n University  (TTU) was successful in acquiring the assets and products of t=\nhe former  CTS.  He also mentioned that yours truly, Dr. Goldman, of the Co=\nach's  Corner, will be leading Vestec, and the parent company (TTU),  to an=\n amazing future.\n=20\n     Before I lead you through  the journey of what is to come, and how it'=\ns going to affect your finances and  your life, please allow me to introduc=\ne myself to those who have not read The  Coach's Corner, or may not be fami=\nliar with Oscar Goldman.  Those of you  who have read The Coach's Corner al=\nready know that I am a 'no nonsense', let's  get to the truth, 'show me the=\n money', kind of guy.  You will also  remember, from past experience, that =\nI will never tell you what you want to  hear, bur rather always tell you wh=\nat you need to hear.  If you talk with  any one of a whole lot of TTU stude=\nnts who have gone through our training  programs, they will always tell you=\n the same thing?This man IS tough, but you  sure don't want to go through a=\nny trading battle without  him.\n=20\n     So, why do I tell  you all this?  It's because you need to know that a=\nny  company that I start, or acquire in this industry, is strictly done out=\n of  SELF-defense.  Let me explain?Just like a good number of you, I have b=\neen  trading for a long time (17 years to be exact), and just like you I we=\nnt through  the school of 'hard knocks', even though I started out with big=\n hopes and  dreams.  And just like most of you, in the beginning I lost my =\nbutt.   So, out of self defense, and being sick and tired of being told wor=\nthless  information, that seemed ok in the beginning, because I didn't know=\n any better,  I decided to start the school that I would want to go to - a =\nprocess that truly  took me from beginner to advanced trader/investor.  And=\n I'm very proud and  grateful to say that Trader Tech University has become=\n the  premier training institute in the world.  I can say that with a great=\n deal  of confidence because the proof is in many of our students' bank acc=\nounts.   Now that you have a picture of who I am, and what we already have,=\n let me tell  you where we're going, and why Vestec.\n=20\n     About two years ago, I was  invited to take a tour of the CTS offices =\nin Florida, before I decided whether  or not to write The Coach's Corner.  =\nAt that time, Nick  Van Nice shared with me that CTS was owned by a group o=\nf investors (as in  investment capital), rather than a group  of traders, w=\nhich I found very curious, considering the fact they had some of  the best =\ntools in the industry.  I now know that a lot of the credit had to  go to N=\nick Van Nice, his father before him, and the group of talented people who  =\nhelped him run the company.  Amazingly enough, it was at that time that I  =\nheard that 'little voice' (we all seem to experience this at one time or an=\nother  in our lives) that told me that my involvement was going to be much =\nbigger than  just writing a column.  I will tell you more about the details=\n of this  story when I see you face to face, but for now, rest assured  tha=\nt what happened in the ensuing two years was nothing short of  miraculous. =\n Because the tools that Joe Van Nice started building more than  20 years a=\ngo were the last missing pieces of the puzzle in my mind that create -  alo=\nng with the other pieces that were there in the TTU company - the perfect  =\ncommand center for the knowing trader/investor - my original  mission was a=\nccomplished.\n=20\n     So, how does all this  benefit you greatly?  It's simple, really.  I h=\nave  recruited and trained the finest team of Generals you would ever want =\nto take to  battle (the Markets).  We have assembled the finest simulator i=\nn the world  (TTU).  We have acquired, refined, and reassembled the  finest=\n tools and weaponry around (Vestec).

I would not be surprised\nto see more of a downside correction soon. Prices pushed to a fresh\nfour-month high Tuesday. Resistance lies at the $74.50 level. First\nsupport lies at the $73.40 level.\n\nAugust feeder cattle closed off $0.27 today, at $91.55. Prices scored\nan \"inside day\" and took a rest after they hit a new contract high\nTuesday. Feeders are still over-extended on a short-term technical\nbasis. A bull flag looks to be forming on the daily bar chart, as\nthis week we saw an upside breakout from that pattern. First\nresistance is seen at $92.00. Looking at the weekly continuation\nchart for nearby futures, the next upside objective for the bulls is\nresistance just above $92.00. First support is seen at $91.00.\n\nAugust lean hogs closed up $1.65 today at $63.35. Prices closed near\nthe session high. The strong rebound continued today, after limit-up\ngains seen Tuesday. The market just got too extended on the downside,\nespecially in the wake Friday's bullish USDA Hogs & Pigs report. Fund\nbuying was featured today, sources said. Prices today broke out above\nand negated a steep five-week-old downtrend. The bulls now have the\nnear-term edge. However, I would not be surprised to see some\nsideways consolidation in the coming sessions. Next resistance lies\nat $64.00. First support is located at the 62.00 level.\n\nGRAINS: July corn futures closed up 3/4 cent at $1.90 today. It was a\nquiet \"rest day\" today after prices Tuesday scored another fresh\ncontract low. Funds have loaded up on the short side now. Good\ngrowing weather in the Midwest and no threatening weather patterns in\nthe forecast continue. This market has no summertime weather premium\nbuilt into it, which will make it very susceptible to an upside spurt\neven with a minor weather scare. I don't think there is much downside\nleft in corn, but I don't want to be a bottom-picker,\neither--tempting as it may be at these low prices. Next support is\nseen at $1.87 3/4. Next resistance is seen at $1.95.\n\nJuly soybeans closed 1 3/4 cents lower at $4.37 1/2 today. Technical\ndamage occurred in the market this week as a five-week-old uptrend\nline on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and\nnegated. Now, it also looks like a minor double-top reversal pattern\ncould be playing out on the daily bar chart. Good growing weather and\nno weather threats on the horizon have allowed the bears to take\ncontrol of this market. Funds have been good sellers in the bean pit\nthis week. Still more downside action this week would not surprise\nme. First support is seen at the $4.35 area. First resistance is now\nseen at $4.45 level.\n\nJuly soybean meal closed off $1.60 at $160.20 today. Another down day\ntoday negates a five-week-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart.\nBears are gaining steam now. After prices pushed to a fresh\nfour-month high Friday, they have seen a solid downside correction\nthis week. Bulls need to stop the bleeding soon or this weakness will\nquickly become more than a downside correction. Next support comes in\nat the $158.00 area. First resistance is seen at $162.60--today's\nhigh.\n\nJuly bean oil closed 6 points higher at 14.80 cents today. Today's\nfollow-through buying has confirmed a key reversal up, after prices\npushed to a fresh contract low on Tuesday and then staged a strong\nrebound. This week, spreaders are unwinding short oil and long meal\npositions. Oil is still technically much weaker than beans or meal.\nBut I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next\nresistance comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at 14.60\ncents.\n\nJuly Chicago wheat closed 3/4 cents lower at $2.64 today. Prices\nclosed near the session low as traders looked at slack demand\nprospects. Earlier in the session, prices were boosted by heavy\nstorms that hit Kansas and Oklahoma the past 24 hours. First support\nlies at the $2.58 1/2 level--the contract low. Next resistance is\nseen at $2.70.\n\nK.C. July HRW wheat closed up 1 cent at $3.20 1/4 today. Prices\ngapped higher today in the wake of the heavy storms that hit parts of\nthe Plains the past 24 hours. However, prices closed on the session\nlow. Still, the upside gap was not filled with the late retreat.\nAlso, there was follow-through buying today and a key reversal up on\nthe daily bar chart was confirmed. Recently, this market has seen a\nseries of V reversals--both up and down. Trading remains volatile.\nNext resistance is seen at the $3.25 level. Next support is seen at\n$3.20.\n\nJuly oats closed up 1/2 cent at $1.12 1/4 today. Prices closed near\nthe session low today, as did wheat. The choppy activity at lower\nprice levels also favors the bulls. The past three weeks have seen\nanother minor uptrend develop on the daily bar chart. Oats will\ncontinue to look to corn and wheat for direction. Next resistance\ncomes in at the $1.14 level. First support now comes in at $1.10.\n\nSOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 15 points lower at 8.59 cents today.\nPrices today dropped to another fresh four-week low as the recent\nhigher volatility at higher price levels has proven bearish. Also,\nthe rare and usually bearish broadening formation continues to play\nout on the daily bar chart. Bears have the technical edge at present.\nHowever, the market is overdone on the downside at present, on a\ntechnical basis. Next support comes in at 8.40 cents--today's low.\nFirst resistance is now seen at 7.72 cents--today's high.\n\nJuly N.Y. coffee closed 65 points lower at 59.15 cents today. Prices\ntoday came within 10 points of the contract low set in April. Bears\nrule. Bulls can only hope for a strong rebound from the present price\nlevel, which would signal a big double-bottom reversal. Still, given\nthe upcoming frost season in South America, I suspect the downside\nfrom present levels will be limited in the coffee market. Speculative\nshort-players won't want to get too brave at this time of year. First\nsupport comes in at the contract low of 58.80 cents. First resistance\nis now seen at 63.00 cents.\n\nJuly N.Y. cocoa closed $39 lower today, at $964. More technical\ndamage was inflicted by the bears today as prices hit another fresh\nthree-week low, as there was follow-through selling from Friday's\ngap-lower trade. The bears are in control, but the market is\nshort-term overdone on the downside at present. Next support comes in\nat $955. First resistance is now seen at $1,009--today's high.\n\nJuly cotton closed 32 points lower at 40.72 cents today. Prices hit a\nfresh contract low just yesterday, in the wake of a bearish USDA\ncotton consumption report last Friday. Cotton is in a strong bear\nmarket and any rebounds will be selling opportunities for the\nbears--for now. My bias is still that we are not that far from a\nbottoming process. Next support lies at 39.95 cents--the contract\nlow. First resistance is seen around 42.00 cents. Recently, I put\nDecember New York cotton futures on my \"Radar Screen\" for a potential\nlong-side trade in the coming weeks. But first (and importantly),\nthis market has to me show solid strength, including some basing\nactivity at these lower levels.\n\nJuly orange juice futures closed 90 points higher today, at 80.40\ncents. Trading has turned volatile lately, but it still favors the\nbullish camp. Bulls pushed prices to a fresh three-month high just\nlast Friday. Prices are still in an uptrend on the daily bar\nchart--albeit a choppy one. Next resistance is now seen at 82.00\ncents. Next support now comes in at 79.00 cents.\n\nJuly lumber futures closed the limit of $10.00 lower today, at\n$322.30. \"What goes up, must come down.\" A V-Top reversal is playing\nout in lumber. I still would be surprised if the upside fireworks are\nover. The market was way overdone on the upside and this still could\nbe just a big correction before still-higher highs are scored. Expect\nmore volatility in the near term--on the upside and downside. The\nnext upside objective for the bulls is the $350.00 level. First\nsupport is seen at $315.00.\n\nMETALS: August COMEX gold futures plummeted by $7.70, to 4267.40 an\nounce. Heavy long liquidation and stop-loss selling were featured in\nthe pit. The recent Commitments of Traders report showed the small\nspeculators had loaded up on the long side of gold futures recently.\nToday, those weak longs were coughing up their positions. News wire\nreports could offer no fundamental reason for the collapse in prices.\nTechnically, once gold dropped to near the $270 level, basis August\nCOMEX futures, the door was open for stop-loss selling and general\nlong liquidation. A big V-Top reversal has now formed and played out\non the daily bar chart. Pit reports said there was not much fresh\nshort selling interest Wednesday. Once again, the gold bulls mustered\nthe strength to show an impressive upside move, only to be kicked in\nthe teeth when a lack of follow-through buying interest at higher\nlevels prompted a price vacuum on the downside. There is a support\nlevel around the $264 area, basis August futures. If that level gives\nway, then the next support comes in at the $260 area. This market is\nnow short-term oversold, on a technical basis. Next resistance on the\nupside is seen at the $275 area. For bulls to really get back on\ntheir feet, they must push prices back above the $290 level. If\nvolatility persists, it will favor the bulls.\n\nJuly silver closed off $0.095 today, at $4.445 an ounce. Like gold,\nlong liquidation and stop-loss selling hit silver today, and it was\nprompted by the sell of in gold. Prices have now backed well off last\nweek's high and could be forming a V-Top reversal on the daily bar\nchart. Bulls today lost much of their momentum they had gained that\nsaw prices push to a three-month high. Still, the recent increase in\nvolatility is suggestive of a bottoming process in silver. Next\nsupport is seen at $4.40. First resistance is now seen at $4.50.\n\nJuly N.Y. copper closed off 45 points today, at 76.25 cents. The sell\noff in the precious metals has impacted copper this week. While this\ndeals the bulls a near-term setback, the higher volatility at lower\nlevels does favor the bulls. My bias is still that the lows are in\nplace for copper. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents. Next\nresistance is seen at 79.00 cents.\n\nENERGIES: July crude closed off $0.14 at $28.52 today. Prices this\nweek are correcting from the big beating they took late last week.\nBears still have the edge, and in fact a bearish flag or pennant\npattern may be forming on the daily bar chart. Next resistance is\nseen at 29.50. Next support lies at $28.00.\n\nJuly heating oil closed 2 points lower today, at .7784. Prices are\nstill correcting downward after they last week hit a fresh\neight-month high. Bulls still have the edge. Next resistance is seen\nat 80.00 cents. Next support is seen at 77.00 cents.\n\nJuly unleaded gasoline closed 139 points lower at .9450 today. Prices\nclosed near the session low as the bears gain confidence. A rare and\nusually bearish broadening formation is developing on the daily bar\nchart. This increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a\ntopping process in the market. Next resistance is seen at $1.00.\nFirst support is seen at $.9300.\n\nJuly natural gas closed 20 cents higher at $4.01 today. Prices today\nsaw a decent rebound from a technically oversold condition. The\nmarket is still oversold on a short-term technical basis. Prices hit\na fresh nine-month low just Tuesday. Bears still have the big\nadvantage. Next support is seen at $3.67--today's low. First\nresistance is seen at $4.25.\n\nSTOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 10\npoints higher at .8567 today. Bears are in control as prices hover\nnear the recent for-the-move low. In fact, a bearish pennant pattern\nmay be forming on the daily bar chart. Measuring implications of that\npattern, should a downside breakout occur, point to losses to the\n.8300 area. Bulls' only hope is that last week's low of .8502 can\nhold the losses. Next support is now seen at .8502. Next resistance\nis seen at .8650.\n\nThe June Japanese yen closed 19 points lower at .8328 today. Prices\npushed to a fresh two-month high last Thursday and are this week\nconsolidating those recent gains. The recent push higher moved prices\nout above the congestion area that had trapped prices for about two\nand one-half months. Bulls still need to show some more upside\nstrength before I am confident in calling this an upside \"breakout.\"\nNext resistance now lies at the .8433 level. First support is now\nseen at the .8200 level.\n\nThe June Swiss franc closed 8 points higher at .5625 today. Like the\nEuro, bulls want to see last week's low hold up before they can gain\nany momentum at all. And like the Euro, a bearish pennant pattern\ncould be forming on the daily bar chart. Measuring implications on a\nconfirmation of the pattern point to losses to the .5400 area. A\n5-month-old accelerating downtrend line is in place on the daily bar\nchart. Next support is seen at the .5588 level--last week's low.\nFirst resistance comes in at the .5700 level.\n\nThe June Australian dollar futures closed 45 points lower at .5124\ntoday. Prices pushed to a fresh 3-month high last week and bulls can\nargue we are seeing corrective consolidation this week. Still,\ndownside price action last week penetrated on the downside and\nnegated a seven-week-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart. Bulls\nshould be worried about this. They need to show some fresh momentum\nsoon. First support is seen at .5069. First resistance is now seen at\n.5225.\n\nThe June Canadian dollar closed 33 points lower today, at .6469.\nPrices closed near the session low. If prices drop below the May low\nof .6425, then bears will be on a level playing field with the bulls.\nThis currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think\nthere is much more downside. In fact, a wedge pattern may be forming\non the daily bar chart that, if confirmed, would likely favor the\nbulls. Next resistance is seen at the .6535 level. First support is\nnow seen at the .6450 level.\n\nThe June British pound closed 42 points higher at 1.4264. Prices are\nrebounding after last Thursday prices fell below the early April low\nof 1.4112. If there would have been follow-through selling, then the\ndoor would have been open to steeper losses. If the losses can be\ncontained and prices rebound, one could still argue that price action\nthe past few weeks has been a \"basing\" before prices eventually turn\nnorth. Next resistance is seen at the 1.4300 level. Next support now\ncomes in at the 1.4150 level.\n\nThe June U.S. dollar index closed 3 points higher at 118.31 today.\nBulls are still in firm control. In fact, a bullish pennant pattern\ncould be forming on the daily bar chart. The index last week pushed\nto a fresh multi-month high. If bulls can push prices above and have\na close above the 119.00 level, then there is likely significantly\nmore upside potential to this rally, even though the index is still a\nbit short-term overbought, technically. There is stiff resistance,\nbasis the longer-term charts, at the 119.00 area. Next resistance\nlies at the 119.00 area. First support is seen at the 117.50 area.\n\nSeptember U.S. T-bonds closed 7/32 higher today at 98 20/32. The\nmarket is consolidating at lower levels. Bears still rule. The next\nupside objective for the bulls is the par level--100 even. But any\nnear-term rebound will be corrective in nature only, until prices can\npush above the 102 area. Prices pushed to a six-month low just\nrecently. First support at 98 6/32.\n\nThe September U.S. T-note closed up 4.5 (32nds) today at 102.00.5.\nPrices fell to a multi-month low just recently as bears rule. Severe\ntechnical damage has been inflicted recently. First support is seen\nat the 101.30.0 level. First resistance is seen at 102.30.5 level.\n\nSeptember Nasdaq futures closed 72.00 lower at 1805.00 today. Bulls\nare losing technical ground that they had gained recently with the\npush above the 2,000 level. It just shows how the stock indexes will\nnot let either the bulls or the bears have much of an edge, before\nprices reverse. First resistance is now seen at 2,000. First support\nis seen at the 1,750 area.\n\nSeptember S&P 500 futures closed 18.70 lower at 1260.10. We are\nseeing some consolidation the past few days after prices hit a fresh\nthree-month high last week. Bulls are still encouraged by the\ncontinuing uptrend off the March low, but they do need to stop the\nslide lower seen the past few sessions. My bias is still that any\nrecovery in the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic,\nbut a slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is\nnow seen at 1300.00. First support is now seen at the 1240.00 area.\n\nDaily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\nINO.com's end-of-day charting software for Futures, Futures\nOptions and Optionable Stocks. http://www.globalcharts.com\nSearch the INO Store  - http://store.ino.com/\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nT O P   N E W S\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nSTOCKS\n\nJapan Stocks Review: Nikkei -2% on Deutsche downgrades/Nasdaq fall\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25601\nAdd2: US Equities Review: DJIA closes below 11,000 on tech selloff\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25599\nUK Stocks Review: Weak tech stocks push FTSE-100 below 5,800\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25607\n\nFOREX\n\nUS FX Review: Dollar remains mixed; traders hunting for clues\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25603\nAsia FX Review: Euro/yen comes under pressure on broad selling\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25600\nEurope FX Review: US fund buying limits euro's losses\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25602\n\nCREDIT\n\nUS Credit Review: Only modest gains despite stock market slide\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25598\nEurope Credit Review: Bond prices range-bound despite firm M3\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25604\nJapan Credit Review: June ends up slightly in range-bound trades\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25606\n\nCOMMODITIES\n\nUS Futures Summary: Gasoline, gold hammered; natural gas soars\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25605\n\nEXCHANGES\n\nNYBOT Announces New Margin Requirements\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24487\nKCBT Value Line\n Margin Changes Announced\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24486\nPacific Exchange To Trade Options on Instinet Group and USEC\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24485\n60% Of IPE Holdings Shares Tendered To IntercontinentalExchange\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24484\nSimon Heale Appointed London Metal Exchange Chief\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24483\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nE X T R E M E   F U T U R E S\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUpdated every 10 minutes around the clock.\nMore at http://quotes.ino.com/analysis/extremes/futures/\n\nWINNERS\n\nNGN1   Henry Hub Natural Gas Jul 2001              3.981     0.200  +5.25\nZM1    U.S. Treasury 6% Bond Jun 2001          103 184/256   4 15/32  +4.50\nLHQ1   Lean Hogs Aug 2001                         63.300     1.600  +2.59\nXHQ1   Lean Hogs Aug 2001                          63.27      1.57  +2.54\nDAU1   BFP Milk Sep 2001                           15.60      0.38  +2.50\nHGK2   Copper May 2002                            0.7905    0.0110  +1.39\nOJN1   Orange Juice Froz.

I would not be surprised\nto see more of a downside correction soon. Prices pushed to a fresh\nfour-month high Tuesday. Resistance lies at the $74.50 level. First\nsupport lies at the $73.40 level.\n\nAugust feeder cattle closed off $0.27 today, at $91.55. Prices scored\nan \"inside day\" and took a rest after they hit a new contract high\nTuesday. Feeders are still over-extended on a short-term technical\nbasis. A bull flag looks to be forming on the daily bar chart, as\nthis week we saw an upside breakout from that pattern. First\nresistance is seen at $92.00. Looking at the weekly continuation\nchart for nearby futures, the next upside objective for the bulls is\nresistance just above $92.00. First support is seen at $91.00.\n\nAugust lean hogs closed up $1.65 today at $63.35. Prices closed near\nthe session high. The strong rebound continued today, after limit-up\ngains seen Tuesday. The market just got too extended on the downside,\nespecially in the wake Friday's bullish USDA Hogs & Pigs report. Fund\nbuying was featured today, sources said. Prices today broke out above\nand negated a steep five-week-old downtrend. The bulls now have the\nnear-term edge. However, I would not be surprised to see some\nsideways consolidation in the coming sessions. Next resistance lies\nat $64.00. First support is located at the 62.00 level.\n\nGRAINS: July corn futures closed up 3/4 cent at $1.90 today. It was a\nquiet \"rest day\" today after prices Tuesday scored another fresh\ncontract low. Funds have loaded up on the short side now. Good\ngrowing weather in the Midwest and no threatening weather patterns in\nthe forecast continue. This market has no summertime weather premium\nbuilt into it, which will make it very susceptible to an upside spurt\neven with a minor weather scare. I don't think there is much downside\nleft in corn, but I don't want to be a bottom-picker,\neither--tempting as it may be at these low prices. Next support is\nseen at $1.87 3/4. Next resistance is seen at $1.95.\n\nJuly soybeans closed 1 3/4 cents lower at $4.37 1/2 today. Technical\ndamage occurred in the market this week as a five-week-old uptrend\nline on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and\nnegated. Now, it also looks like a minor double-top reversal pattern\ncould be playing out on the daily bar chart. Good growing weather and\nno weather threats on the horizon have allowed the bears to take\ncontrol of this market. Funds have been good sellers in the bean pit\nthis week. Still more downside action this week would not surprise\nme. First support is seen at the $4.35 area. First resistance is now\nseen at $4.45 level.\n\nJuly soybean meal closed off $1.60 at $160.20 today. Another down day\ntoday negates a five-week-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart.\nBears are gaining steam now. After prices pushed to a fresh\nfour-month high Friday, they have seen a solid downside correction\nthis week. Bulls need to stop the bleeding soon or this weakness will\nquickly become more than a downside correction. Next support comes in\nat the $158.00 area. First resistance is seen at $162.60--today's\nhigh.\n\nJuly bean oil closed 6 points higher at 14.80 cents today. Today's\nfollow-through buying has confirmed a key reversal up, after prices\npushed to a fresh contract low on Tuesday and then staged a strong\nrebound. This week, spreaders are unwinding short oil and long meal\npositions. Oil is still technically much weaker than beans or meal.\nBut I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next\nresistance comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at 14.60\ncents.\n\nJuly Chicago wheat closed 3/4 cents lower at $2.64 today. Prices\nclosed near the session low as traders looked at slack demand\nprospects. Earlier in the session, prices were boosted by heavy\nstorms that hit Kansas and Oklahoma the past 24 hours. First support\nlies at the $2.58 1/2 level--the contract low. Next resistance is\nseen at $2.70.\n\nK.C. July HRW wheat closed up 1 cent at $3.20 1/4 today. Prices\ngapped higher today in the wake of the heavy storms that hit parts of\nthe Plains the past 24 hours. However, prices closed on the session\nlow. Still, the upside gap was not filled with the late retreat.\nAlso, there was follow-through buying today and a key reversal up on\nthe daily bar chart was confirmed. Recently, this market has seen a\nseries of V reversals--both up and down. Trading remains volatile.\nNext resistance is seen at the $3.25 level. Next support is seen at\n$3.20.\n\nJuly oats closed up 1/2 cent at $1.12 1/4 today. Prices closed near\nthe session low today, as did wheat. The choppy activity at lower\nprice levels also favors the bulls. The past three weeks have seen\nanother minor uptrend develop on the daily bar chart. Oats will\ncontinue to look to corn and wheat for direction. Next resistance\ncomes in at the $1.14 level. First support now comes in at $1.10.\n\nSOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 15 points lower at 8.59 cents today.\nPrices today dropped to another fresh four-week low as the recent\nhigher volatility at higher price levels has proven bearish. Also,\nthe rare and usually bearish broadening formation continues to play\nout on the daily bar chart. Bears have the technical edge at present.\nHowever, the market is overdone on the downside at present, on a\ntechnical basis. Next support comes in at 8.40 cents--today's low.\nFirst resistance is now seen at 7.72 cents--today's high.\n\nJuly N.Y. coffee closed 65 points lower at 59.15 cents today. Prices\ntoday came within 10 points of the contract low set in April. Bears\nrule. Bulls can only hope for a strong rebound from the present price\nlevel, which would signal a big double-bottom reversal. Still, given\nthe upcoming frost season in South America, I suspect the downside\nfrom present levels will be limited in the coffee market. Speculative\nshort-players won't want to get too brave at this time of year. First\nsupport comes in at the contract low of 58.80 cents. First resistance\nis now seen at 63.00 cents.\n\nJuly N.Y. cocoa closed $39 lower today, at $964. More technical\ndamage was inflicted by the bears today as prices hit another fresh\nthree-week low, as there was follow-through selling from Friday's\ngap-lower trade. The bears are in control, but the market is\nshort-term overdone on the downside at present. Next support comes in\nat $955. First resistance is now seen at $1,009--today's high.\n\nJuly cotton closed 32 points lower at 40.72 cents today. Prices hit a\nfresh contract low just yesterday, in the wake of a bearish USDA\ncotton consumption report last Friday. Cotton is in a strong bear\nmarket and any rebounds will be selling opportunities for the\nbears--for now. My bias is still that we are not that far from a\nbottoming process. Next support lies at 39.95 cents--the contract\nlow. First resistance is seen around 42.00 cents. Recently, I put\nDecember New York cotton futures on my \"Radar Screen\" for a potential\nlong-side trade in the coming weeks. But first (and importantly),\nthis market has to me show solid strength, including some basing\nactivity at these lower levels.\n\nJuly orange juice futures closed 90 points higher today, at 80.40\ncents. Trading has turned volatile lately, but it still favors the\nbullish camp. Bulls pushed prices to a fresh three-month high just\nlast Friday. Prices are still in an uptrend on the daily bar\nchart--albeit a choppy one. Next resistance is now seen at 82.00\ncents. Next support now comes in at 79.00 cents.\n\nJuly lumber futures closed the limit of $10.00 lower today, at\n$322.30. \"What goes up, must come down.\" A V-Top reversal is playing\nout in lumber. I still would be surprised if the upside fireworks are\nover. The market was way overdone on the upside and this still could\nbe just a big correction before still-higher highs are scored. Expect\nmore volatility in the near term--on the upside and downside. The\nnext upside objective for the bulls is the $350.00 level. First\nsupport is seen at $315.00.\n\nMETALS: August COMEX gold futures plummeted by $7.70, to 4267.40 an\nounce. Heavy long liquidation and stop-loss selling were featured in\nthe pit. The recent Commitments of Traders report showed the small\nspeculators had loaded up on the long side of gold futures recently.\nToday, those weak longs were coughing up their positions. News wire\nreports could offer no fundamental reason for the collapse in prices.\nTechnically, once gold dropped to near the $270 level, basis August\nCOMEX futures, the door was open for stop-loss selling and general\nlong liquidation. A big V-Top reversal has now formed and played out\non the daily bar chart. Pit reports said there was not much fresh\nshort selling interest Wednesday. Once again, the gold bulls mustered\nthe strength to show an impressive upside move, only to be kicked in\nthe teeth when a lack of follow-through buying interest at higher\nlevels prompted a price vacuum on the downside. There is a support\nlevel around the $264 area, basis August futures. If that level gives\nway, then the next support comes in at the $260 area. This market is\nnow short-term oversold, on a technical basis. Next resistance on the\nupside is seen at the $275 area. For bulls to really get back on\ntheir feet, they must push prices back above the $290 level. If\nvolatility persists, it will favor the bulls.\n\nJuly silver closed off $0.095 today, at $4.445 an ounce. Like gold,\nlong liquidation and stop-loss selling hit silver today, and it was\nprompted by the sell of in gold. Prices have now backed well off last\nweek's high and could be forming a V-Top reversal on the daily bar\nchart. Bulls today lost much of their momentum they had gained that\nsaw prices push to a three-month high. Still, the recent increase in\nvolatility is suggestive of a bottoming process in silver. Next\nsupport is seen at $4.40. First resistance is now seen at $4.50.\n\nJuly N.Y. copper closed off 45 points today, at 76.25 cents. The sell\noff in the precious metals has impacted copper this week. While this\ndeals the bulls a near-term setback, the higher volatility at lower\nlevels does favor the bulls. My bias is still that the lows are in\nplace for copper. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents. Next\nresistance is seen at 79.00 cents.\n\nENERGIES: July crude closed off $0.14 at $28.52 today. Prices this\nweek are correcting from the big beating they took late last week.\nBears still have the edge, and in fact a bearish flag or pennant\npattern may be forming on the daily bar chart. Next resistance is\nseen at 29.50. Next support lies at $28.00.\n\nJuly heating oil closed 2 points lower today, at .7784. Prices are\nstill correcting downward after they last week hit a fresh\neight-month high. Bulls still have the edge. Next resistance is seen\nat 80.00 cents. Next support is seen at 77.00 cents.\n\nJuly unleaded gasoline closed 139 points lower at .9450 today. Prices\nclosed near the session low as the bears gain confidence. A rare and\nusually bearish broadening formation is developing on the daily bar\nchart. This increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a\ntopping process in the market. Next resistance is seen at $1.00.\nFirst support is seen at $.9300.\n\nJuly natural gas closed 20 cents higher at $4.01 today. Prices today\nsaw a decent rebound from a technically oversold condition. The\nmarket is still oversold on a short-term technical basis. Prices hit\na fresh nine-month low just Tuesday. Bears still have the big\nadvantage. Next support is seen at $3.67--today's low. First\nresistance is seen at $4.25.\n\nSTOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 10\npoints higher at .8567 today. Bears are in control as prices hover\nnear the recent for-the-move low. In fact, a bearish pennant pattern\nmay be forming on the daily bar chart. Measuring implications of that\npattern, should a downside breakout occur, point to losses to the\n.8300 area. Bulls' only hope is that last week's low of .8502 can\nhold the losses. Next support is now seen at .8502. Next resistance\nis seen at .8650.\n\nThe June Japanese yen closed 19 points lower at .8328 today. Prices\npushed to a fresh two-month high last Thursday and are this week\nconsolidating those recent gains. The recent push higher moved prices\nout above the congestion area that had trapped prices for about two\nand one-half months. Bulls still need to show some more upside\nstrength before I am confident in calling this an upside \"breakout.\"\nNext resistance now lies at the .8433 level. First support is now\nseen at the .8200 level.\n\nThe June Swiss franc closed 8 points higher at .5625 today. Like the\nEuro, bulls want to see last week's low hold up before they can gain\nany momentum at all. And like the Euro, a bearish pennant pattern\ncould be forming on the daily bar chart. Measuring implications on a\nconfirmation of the pattern point to losses to the .5400 area. A\n5-month-old accelerating downtrend line is in place on the daily bar\nchart. Next support is seen at the .5588 level--last week's low.\nFirst resistance comes in at the .5700 level.\n\nThe June Australian dollar futures closed 45 points lower at .5124\ntoday. Prices pushed to a fresh 3-month high last week and bulls can\nargue we are seeing corrective consolidation this week. Still,\ndownside price action last week penetrated on the downside and\nnegated a seven-week-old uptrend line on the daily bar chart. Bulls\nshould be worried about this. They need to show some fresh momentum\nsoon. First support is seen at .5069. First resistance is now seen at\n.5225.\n\nThe June Canadian dollar closed 33 points lower today, at .6469.\nPrices closed near the session low. If prices drop below the May low\nof .6425, then bears will be on a level playing field with the bulls.\nThis currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think\nthere is much more downside. In fact, a wedge pattern may be forming\non the daily bar chart that, if confirmed, would likely favor the\nbulls. Next resistance is seen at the .6535 level. First support is\nnow seen at the .6450 level.\n\nThe June British pound closed 42 points higher at 1.4264. Prices are\nrebounding after last Thursday prices fell below the early April low\nof 1.4112. If there would have been follow-through selling, then the\ndoor would have been open to steeper losses. If the losses can be\ncontained and prices rebound, one could still argue that price action\nthe past few weeks has been a \"basing\" before prices eventually turn\nnorth. Next resistance is seen at the 1.4300 level. Next support now\ncomes in at the 1.4150 level.\n\nThe June U.S. dollar index closed 3 points higher at 118.31 today.\nBulls are still in firm control. In fact, a bullish pennant pattern\ncould be forming on the daily bar chart. The index last week pushed\nto a fresh multi-month high. If bulls can push prices above and have\na close above the 119.00 level, then there is likely significantly\nmore upside potential to this rally, even though the index is still a\nbit short-term overbought, technically. There is stiff resistance,\nbasis the longer-term charts, at the 119.00 area. Next resistance\nlies at the 119.00 area. First support is seen at the 117.50 area.\n\nSeptember U.S. T-bonds closed 7/32 higher today at 98 20/32. The\nmarket is consolidating at lower levels. Bears still rule. The next\nupside objective for the bulls is the par level--100 even. But any\nnear-term rebound will be corrective in nature only, until prices can\npush above the 102 area. Prices pushed to a six-month low just\nrecently. First support at 98 6/32.\n\nThe September U.S. T-note closed up 4.5 (32nds) today at 102.00.5.\nPrices fell to a multi-month low just recently as bears rule. Severe\ntechnical damage has been inflicted recently. First support is seen\nat the 101.30.0 level. First resistance is seen at 102.30.5 level.\n\nSeptember Nasdaq futures closed 72.00 lower at 1805.00 today. Bulls\nare losing technical ground that they had gained recently with the\npush above the 2,000 level. It just shows how the stock indexes will\nnot let either the bulls or the bears have much of an edge, before\nprices reverse. First resistance is now seen at 2,000. First support\nis seen at the 1,750 area.\n\nSeptember S&P 500 futures closed 18.70 lower at 1260.10. We are\nseeing some consolidation the past few days after prices hit a fresh\nthree-month high last week. Bulls are still encouraged by the\ncontinuing uptrend off the March low, but they do need to stop the\nslide lower seen the past few sessions. My bias is still that any\nrecovery in the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic,\nbut a slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is\nnow seen at 1300.00. First support is now seen at the 1240.00 area.\n\nDaily Extreme Commentary is brought to you by GLOBALcharts,\nINO.com's end-of-day charting software for Futures, Futures\nOptions and Optionable Stocks. http://www.globalcharts.com\nSearch the INO Store  - http://store.ino.com/\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nT O P   N E W S\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nSTOCKS\n\nJapan Stocks Review: Nikkei -2% on Deutsche downgrades/Nasdaq fall\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25601\nAdd2: US Equities Review: DJIA closes below 11,000 on tech selloff\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25599\nUK Stocks Review: Weak tech stocks push FTSE-100 below 5,800\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25607\n\nFOREX\n\nUS FX Review: Dollar remains mixed; traders hunting for clues\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25603\nAsia FX Review: Euro/yen comes under pressure on broad selling\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25600\nEurope FX Review: US fund buying limits euro's losses\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25602\n\nCREDIT\n\nUS Credit Review: Only modest gains despite stock market slide\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25598\nEurope Credit Review: Bond prices range-bound despite firm M3\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25604\nJapan Credit Review: June ends up slightly in range-bound trades\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25606\n\nCOMMODITIES\n\nUS Futures Summary: Gasoline, gold hammered; natural gas soars\n   http://news.ino.com/summary/?id=25605\n\nEXCHANGES\n\nNYBOT Announces New Margin Requirements\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24487\nKCBT Value Line\n Margin Changes Announced\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24486\nPacific Exchange To Trade Options on Instinet Group and USEC\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24485\n60% Of IPE Holdings Shares Tendered To IntercontinentalExchange\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24484\nSimon Heale Appointed London Metal Exchange Chief\n   http://news.ino.com/press/?release=24483\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nE X T R E M E   F U T U R E S\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nUpdated every 10 minutes around the clock.\nMore at http://quotes.ino.com/analysis/extremes/futures/\n\nWINNERS\n\nNGN1   Henry Hub Natural Gas Jul 2001              3.981     0.200  +5.25\nZM1    U.S. Treasury 6% Bond Jun 2001          103 184/256   4 15/32  +4.50\nLHQ1   Lean Hogs Aug 2001                         63.300     1.600  +2.59\nXHQ1   Lean Hogs Aug 2001                          63.27      1.57  +2.54\nDAU1   BFP Milk Sep 2001                           15.60      0.38  +2.50\nHGK2   Copper May 2002                            0.7905    0.0110  +1.39\nOJN1   Orange Juice Froz.

The combined model would provide fuel burned on forecasted demand. =\n =20\nInitial analysis looks promising and they hope to give us an answer by next=\n=20\nweek whether the FPM model can be used as is.=20\n\nBeaver to Mullinville B-C Sweeping=20\n Pipeline operating conditions have been analyzed since the sweep was=20\ncompleted on 09/21/00.  Recent sweeps had improved flow efficiency only abo=\nut=20\n5%.  Last week's sweep improved the efficiency by 35% to about 85%.  Pressu=\nre=20\ndrops decreased from 125 PSI down to about 40 PSI.  Mullinville has operate=\nd=20\nwith one less 2000 HP unit while Beaver units are operating with less load=\n=20\nwhile producing lower suctions.\n\nOutage Modeling\nRan hydraulic models for Gas Control to determine flows with Bisti down and=\n=20\nwith Unit 303 down.\n\nSan Juan Efficiency Study\nDeveloped multiple scenarios for San Juan flows and pressures if the line w=\nas=20\nto be cleaned.  Basic economic analysis was also performed.\n\nHydraulic Model for EOTT\nThe current EOTT hydraulic model has been revised to include the dependence=\n=20\nof the fluid properties on temperature and pressure as well the appropriate=\n=20\nheat transfer considerations.\n\n\nHouston Facility Planning Team    (Team Leader: Perry Frazier 713/853-0667)\n\nTW Expansion Studies=20\nLooked at different combinations of pipe loop and compression trying to=20\nreduce overall costs.  No luck so far.  A brainstorming session is schedule=\nd=20\nnext week to see if there are any different approaches not considered to da=\nte.\nEl Paso Field Services\nCompiling information for inclusion into the Interconnect and Operating=20\nAgreement between EPFS and Enron.  Mostly locations, materials and POI=20\nnumber, expect to have all information gathered by the end of the week.\n\nSan Juan Lateral\nEnron Operations Services has visited 3 laboratories in the area and compil=\ned=20\ninformation on their analysis procedures.  They want Facility Planning to=\n=20\nhelp evaluate and choose one for the sample evaluation.  Results will take=\n=20\nabout 2 weeks.  Also, received some expected flow/pressure enhancements for=\n=20\nthe last 30 - 40 miles of the SJ Lateral, using the expected efficiencies=\n=20\ncalculated for a pressure profile taken after the 1998 chemical cleaning=20\nrun.   Results will be reported next week.=20\n\nLiberal Operations - PRIDE Meeting\nAttended operations meeting in Liberal that covered various areas of=20\noperations and ways to improve.  Facility Planning did a presentation on th=\ne=20\nproposed Emergency Response Program and provided general information on=20\nFacility Planning services that can assist Operations.\n\nProspective Market Zone Wichita, Kansas\nCommercial requested market study of competitor pipelines serving the=20\nWichita, Kansas area (Duke, KPL, Williams), research possible load=20\nrequirements, and facility requirements to connect the area to NNG's pipeli=\nne=20\nsystem.  Wichita is located about 90 miles from the Macksville compressor=\n=20\nstation as a crow flies.\nOutage Coordination=20\n Provided the study to determine flows on the San Juan lateral and mainline=\n=20\nwhen Bisti outage occurs in October.  Both San Juan and the mainline will=\n=20\nhave reduced flows.  Study results were given to Market Services. Also=20\nprovided support for System Optimization to determine the flows west when=\n=20\nStation #3 unit 3 is out of service.\n\nMarketing Strategy Meeting=20\nAttended and participated in the Marketing Strategy meeting.  Main assignme=\nnt=20\nfor Planning is to continue looking for revenue generating projects.\n\nE&C\nParticipated in a review of the responding candidates for the vacant Projec=\nt=20\nEngineering position.\n\n\n\nOmaha Facility Planning Team     (Team Leader: Steve Thomas 402-398-7468)\n\nEarlville Outage\nOn October 12th starting at 8:00 am the Earlville unit will be taken down f=\nor=20\nrelocation of the blow down silencer.   Solar will also be on site to do so=\nme=20\nbleed air manifold baffle modifications.  After this work is completed, the=\n=20\nDistrict will perform a water wash in preparation for emissions testing on=\n=20\nOctober 16th & 17th.  The unit should be back on-line sometime near midnigh=\nt=20\non October 12th.\n\nWith Earlville down for this time frame the flow on the East leg will be=20\nlimited to the 660-680 mmcf/d range.  We anticipate that normal nominations=\n=20\nwill be below this threshold, and that by packing the system the night befo=\nre=20\nwe will be able to make it through without any impact.   Gas Control is=20\nputting this outage on the EBB.  From a Marketing perspective we should lim=\nit=20\nshort term sustainables, but Ops did not want to call an allocation day.  I=\nf=20\nwe did, the allocation would be 86% of firm in Zone D for all deliveries. =\n=20\n\nThe emissions testing on October 16th & 17th will have very little impact o=\nn=20\nsystem flows.\n\nPlanning White Paper\nPlanning met with various Marketing representatives to try and attach a val=\nue=20\nto the four ideas put forth in the White Paper.   The ideas were thoroughly=\n=20\ndiscussed and the input we received will be incorporated into the Paper.  =\n=20\nOne suggestion was that we use the Pricing Desk to determine the value of t=\nhe=20\nadditional capacity.  We will be meeting with them to do that.  Meanwhile=\n=20\nresearch continues on the various costs associated with the White Paper,=20\nspecifically sites for proposed inlet pressure additions. =20\n\nEngineering Records Research\nEOG - Texas Co. #4 (C.000269.01): =20\nThis is an interconnect where the Texas Co. #4 8\" Lateral (OKG-19301)=20\nconnected to the 24\" OKM-12001.  An incorrect line number on the project=20\nauthorization located the project six miles upstream of the actual site. =\n=20\nEngineering Records did not have the one page amendment with the project=20\nauthorization to explain who owns and operates the facilities.  Texas Co. #=\n4=20\nfacilities had been removed.  The remaining pipe downstream of the compress=\nor=20\nsite to OKM-12001 (approximately 4.5 miles) has been transferred to EOG=20\nResources as of June 16, 2000.  (Project Authorization C.000369.02/Removal)=\n.\n\nOgden H2S Monitor (SN0157): =20\nVerification of materials used in the construction of the monitor was=20\nneeded.  Operations confirmed that a Farm Tap Assembly was used to create t=\nhe=20\nmonitoring facilities, not to install a farm tap within the Ogden Plant yar=\nd.=20\n=20\nCedar Falls #2\nMarketing needed to know if there was any money left in the work order to=\n=20\npurchase a new regulator, since the interruptible peaking turbine load is=\n=20\ncausing problems with the existing regulator.  Property Accounting reported=\n=20\nthe amount remaining, but it will not be enough for a new regulator.\n\nSt. Croix Valley\nProvided options for the proposed ten year expansion for St. Croix Valley. =\n=20\nExamined cost versus incremental growth on the Black River Falls Branchline=\n. =20\nProvided an analysis for option of integrating the growth with the Wisconsi=\nn=20\nGas proposal.  Following the latest strategic marketing meeting, will exami=\nne=20\ncompression alternatives for St. Criox Valley as a stand-alone project.\n\nGrimes #1 TBS - Pressure Increase\nWorking with Marketing and the Field.  Examined several options regarding t=\nhe=20\ncustomer=01,s request for a pressure increase to a delivery of 150 psig. =\n=20\nMarketing will examine all the options in order to determine best strategic=\n=20\nfit for the customer.\n\nOgden Building #2 Discharge Pressure\nResearch has been completed in trying to locate documentation that supports=\n=20\nthe 1000 psig MAOP for the building #2 discharge header.  The supporting=20\ndocumentation has been forwarded to Lisa Choquette in Codes for approval.  =\nIf=20\ndocumentation is approved as supporting evidence for the 1000 psig MAOP the=\nn=20\nonly minor controls work will be required in the field in order to increase=\n=20\nthe discharge pressure of the building #2 engines. =20\n\nPengilly TBS - Mesabi System\nMarketing was presented with two separate estimates for modification requir=\ned=20\nto increase firm at Pengilly from 12 mcf/day to 210 mcf/day.   The first=20\nestimate for $85,000 consisted mostly of contract labor with field personne=\nl=20\nonly installing the EFM.  The team responded with a proposal that they woul=\nd=20\nbe willing to do all of the labor if it could be scheduled during Jan-March=\n. =20\nA second estimate of $66,000 was submitted to Marketing, which included all=\n=20\ndistrict labor.  This estimate is contingent on completing the deal prior t=\no=20\nDec 31,2000.  If a deal is made after Dec 31, 2000 then the higher cost=20\nestimate applies.\n\nMonroe #1 TBS Mods / Pressure Increase\nThe Monroe #1 TBS Mods Project was released to Engineering.   The project w=\nas=20\nthe result of WIGas raising the IT load by approximately 4000 mcf/day.  The=\ny=20\nalso requested a pressure increase at the station from 80 psig to 275=20\npsig.    A Form 2476 \"Pressure Increase Request Form\" is being circulated f=\nor=20\nsignature.  The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The=\n=20\nmodifications consist of replacing both meters with spool pieces and=20\nperforming a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP.\n\nMilbank Project\nContinued gathering data to model the Milbank system as it is today.\n\nMelbourne #1 - Project Release\nThe Melbourne #1 TBS Mods project was released to Engineering.   The projec=\nt=20\nconsists of TBS mods to support the increase of firm from 330 mcf/day to 50=\n0=20\nmcf/day at Melbourne. Presently the Marshalltown B/L is constrained and cou=\nld=20\nnot support the incremental firm.  Alliant will realign gas away from the=\n=20\nMarshalltown #1 TBS which is at the end of this B/L to the Marshalltown #1A=\n=20\nTBS which is on a different B/L.  This will open up capacity on the line fo=\nr=20\nthis new load.   The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date. =\n=20\nModifications consist of replacing the first and second cut regulators and=\n=20\nreplacing the meter.\n\nAdel #1A TBS Mods - project release\nThe Adel #1A TBS Mods Project was released to engineering.  This project wa=\ns=20\na result of the customer wanting to convert an existing IT load at Adel #1A=\n=20\nto a Firm load.  The new Firm load will be 1400 mcf/day.   The project has =\na=20\ntargeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The station will have a new meter=\n=20\ninstalled along with piping size modifications.\n\nEthanol Injection\nReviewed and researched (for Marketing) the possibility of injecting Ethano=\nl=20\ninto the pipeline for a possible \"Green Energy\" rating and as a means of BT=\nU=20\nenhancement.  Since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline=20\nconditions, even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not=\n=20\ninsure the Ethanol from liquefying, dropping out and collecting into the=20\npipeline low spots.  Also, there were many issues concerning possible liqui=\nds=20\nentering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers=01, equipmen=\nt. =20\nPlanning recommended that this project not be pursued.\n\nResearched (for Marketing) was the possibility of burning a Methane/Ethanol=\n=20\nmix in our equipment (i.e.: Turbines) in order to receive a \"Green Power\"=\n=20\nrating.  Solar was contacted concerning the possibility of \"co-burning\"=20\nethanol and methane.  As a manufacturer they said they would be willing to=\n=20\nwork with us, however, they only recommended it if it were to be a constant=\n=20\nfuel source.  Solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system=\n=20\nretrofits required.  Also, if this were not a constant fuel then there woul=\nd=20\nhave to be two separate fuel systems (co-burn and methane only) and a=20\ncomplete fuel control system change.  With all that the project has been=20\ndeemed cost prohibitive.\n\nVapor Injection of Propane (VIP Service)\nResearch was started for Marketing into the possibility of injecting=20\nvaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity during=\n=20\npeak days.  Upon initial review many questions were generated by the planni=\nng=20\nteam concerning specific requirements of the new service (i.e.: # of days/y=\nr,=20\nfirm, daily firm etc.)  Planning awaits feedback from Marketing before any=\n=20\nmore action is taken.\n\nElectric Generation=20\nProposal was reviewed for Marketing from APA for an engineering study to=20\nreview the possibility of utilizing stand-by generators as electric produce=\nrs=20\nfor the Utilities during peak power times in the summer months.  A few=20\ndiscrepancies were found and are being worked out before APA can be release=\nd=20\nto complete the engineering study.\n\nBeaver Dehy\nA request was received from John Sturn of the optimization team to review t=\nhe=20\nCapacity of the Mole sieve Dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the =\nSE=20\n24\" line.  Beaver is considering a capital project to re-route the dehy=20\nsystem that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the=20\ndischarge, thus increasing the capacity. =20\n\nCogentrix Power Plant\nThree detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were=\n=20\nprepared and forwarded to Marketing.

The combined model would provide fuel burned on forecasted demand. =\n =20\nInitial analysis looks promising and they hope to give us an answer by next=\n=20\nweek whether the FPM model can be used as is.=20\n\nBeaver to Mullinville B-C Sweeping=20\n Pipeline operating conditions have been analyzed since the sweep was=20\ncompleted on 09/21/00.  Recent sweeps had improved flow efficiency only abo=\nut=20\n5%.  Last week's sweep improved the efficiency by 35% to about 85%.  Pressu=\nre=20\ndrops decreased from 125 PSI down to about 40 PSI.  Mullinville has operate=\nd=20\nwith one less 2000 HP unit while Beaver units are operating with less load=\n=20\nwhile producing lower suctions.\n\nOutage Modeling\nRan hydraulic models for Gas Control to determine flows with Bisti down and=\n=20\nwith Unit 303 down.\n\nSan Juan Efficiency Study\nDeveloped multiple scenarios for San Juan flows and pressures if the line w=\nas=20\nto be cleaned.  Basic economic analysis was also performed.\n\nHydraulic Model for EOTT\nThe current EOTT hydraulic model has been revised to include the dependence=\n=20\nof the fluid properties on temperature and pressure as well the appropriate=\n=20\nheat transfer considerations.\n\n\nHouston Facility Planning Team    (Team Leader: Perry Frazier 713/853-0667)\n\nTW Expansion Studies=20\nLooked at different combinations of pipe loop and compression trying to=20\nreduce overall costs.  No luck so far.  A brainstorming session is schedule=\nd=20\nnext week to see if there are any different approaches not considered to da=\nte.\nEl Paso Field Services\nCompiling information for inclusion into the Interconnect and Operating=20\nAgreement between EPFS and Enron.  Mostly locations, materials and POI=20\nnumber, expect to have all information gathered by the end of the week.\n\nSan Juan Lateral\nEnron Operations Services has visited 3 laboratories in the area and compil=\ned=20\ninformation on their analysis procedures.  They want Facility Planning to=\n=20\nhelp evaluate and choose one for the sample evaluation.  Results will take=\n=20\nabout 2 weeks.  Also, received some expected flow/pressure enhancements for=\n=20\nthe last 30 - 40 miles of the SJ Lateral, using the expected efficiencies=\n=20\ncalculated for a pressure profile taken after the 1998 chemical cleaning=20\nrun.   Results will be reported next week.=20\n\nLiberal Operations - PRIDE Meeting\nAttended operations meeting in Liberal that covered various areas of=20\noperations and ways to improve.  Facility Planning did a presentation on th=\ne=20\nproposed Emergency Response Program and provided general information on=20\nFacility Planning services that can assist Operations.\n\nProspective Market Zone Wichita, Kansas\nCommercial requested market study of competitor pipelines serving the=20\nWichita, Kansas area (Duke, KPL, Williams), research possible load=20\nrequirements, and facility requirements to connect the area to NNG's pipeli=\nne=20\nsystem.  Wichita is located about 90 miles from the Macksville compressor=\n=20\nstation as a crow flies.\nOutage Coordination=20\n Provided the study to determine flows on the San Juan lateral and mainline=\n=20\nwhen Bisti outage occurs in October.  Both San Juan and the mainline will=\n=20\nhave reduced flows.  Study results were given to Market Services. Also=20\nprovided support for System Optimization to determine the flows west when=\n=20\nStation #3 unit 3 is out of service.\n\nMarketing Strategy Meeting=20\nAttended and participated in the Marketing Strategy meeting.  Main assignme=\nnt=20\nfor Planning is to continue looking for revenue generating projects.\n\nE&C\nParticipated in a review of the responding candidates for the vacant Projec=\nt=20\nEngineering position.\n\n\n\nOmaha Facility Planning Team     (Team Leader: Steve Thomas 402-398-7468)\n\nEarlville Outage\nOn October 12th starting at 8:00 am the Earlville unit will be taken down f=\nor=20\nrelocation of the blow down silencer.   Solar will also be on site to do so=\nme=20\nbleed air manifold baffle modifications.  After this work is completed, the=\n=20\nDistrict will perform a water wash in preparation for emissions testing on=\n=20\nOctober 16th & 17th.  The unit should be back on-line sometime near midnigh=\nt=20\non October 12th.\n\nWith Earlville down for this time frame the flow on the East leg will be=20\nlimited to the 660-680 mmcf/d range.  We anticipate that normal nominations=\n=20\nwill be below this threshold, and that by packing the system the night befo=\nre=20\nwe will be able to make it through without any impact.   Gas Control is=20\nputting this outage on the EBB.  From a Marketing perspective we should lim=\nit=20\nshort term sustainables, but Ops did not want to call an allocation day.  I=\nf=20\nwe did, the allocation would be 86% of firm in Zone D for all deliveries. =\n=20\n\nThe emissions testing on October 16th & 17th will have very little impact o=\nn=20\nsystem flows.\n\nPlanning White Paper\nPlanning met with various Marketing representatives to try and attach a val=\nue=20\nto the four ideas put forth in the White Paper.   The ideas were thoroughly=\n=20\ndiscussed and the input we received will be incorporated into the Paper.  =\n=20\nOne suggestion was that we use the Pricing Desk to determine the value of t=\nhe=20\nadditional capacity.  We will be meeting with them to do that.  Meanwhile=\n=20\nresearch continues on the various costs associated with the White Paper,=20\nspecifically sites for proposed inlet pressure additions. =20\n\nEngineering Records Research\nEOG - Texas Co. #4 (C.000269.01): =20\nThis is an interconnect where the Texas Co. #4 8\" Lateral (OKG-19301)=20\nconnected to the 24\" OKM-12001.  An incorrect line number on the project=20\nauthorization located the project six miles upstream of the actual site. =\n=20\nEngineering Records did not have the one page amendment with the project=20\nauthorization to explain who owns and operates the facilities.  Texas Co. #=\n4=20\nfacilities had been removed.  The remaining pipe downstream of the compress=\nor=20\nsite to OKM-12001 (approximately 4.5 miles) has been transferred to EOG=20\nResources as of June 16, 2000.  (Project Authorization C.000369.02/Removal)=\n.\n\nOgden H2S Monitor (SN0157): =20\nVerification of materials used in the construction of the monitor was=20\nneeded.  Operations confirmed that a Farm Tap Assembly was used to create t=\nhe=20\nmonitoring facilities, not to install a farm tap within the Ogden Plant yar=\nd.=20\n=20\nCedar Falls #2\nMarketing needed to know if there was any money left in the work order to=\n=20\npurchase a new regulator, since the interruptible peaking turbine load is=\n=20\ncausing problems with the existing regulator.  Property Accounting reported=\n=20\nthe amount remaining, but it will not be enough for a new regulator.\n\nSt. Croix Valley\nProvided options for the proposed ten year expansion for St. Croix Valley. =\n=20\nExamined cost versus incremental growth on the Black River Falls Branchline=\n. =20\nProvided an analysis for option of integrating the growth with the Wisconsi=\nn=20\nGas proposal.  Following the latest strategic marketing meeting, will exami=\nne=20\ncompression alternatives for St. Criox Valley as a stand-alone project.\n\nGrimes #1 TBS - Pressure Increase\nWorking with Marketing and the Field.  Examined several options regarding t=\nhe=20\ncustomer=01,s request for a pressure increase to a delivery of 150 psig. =\n=20\nMarketing will examine all the options in order to determine best strategic=\n=20\nfit for the customer.\n\nOgden Building #2 Discharge Pressure\nResearch has been completed in trying to locate documentation that supports=\n=20\nthe 1000 psig MAOP for the building #2 discharge header.  The supporting=20\ndocumentation has been forwarded to Lisa Choquette in Codes for approval.  =\nIf=20\ndocumentation is approved as supporting evidence for the 1000 psig MAOP the=\nn=20\nonly minor controls work will be required in the field in order to increase=\n=20\nthe discharge pressure of the building #2 engines. =20\n\nPengilly TBS - Mesabi System\nMarketing was presented with two separate estimates for modification requir=\ned=20\nto increase firm at Pengilly from 12 mcf/day to 210 mcf/day.   The first=20\nestimate for $85,000 consisted mostly of contract labor with field personne=\nl=20\nonly installing the EFM.  The team responded with a proposal that they woul=\nd=20\nbe willing to do all of the labor if it could be scheduled during Jan-March=\n. =20\nA second estimate of $66,000 was submitted to Marketing, which included all=\n=20\ndistrict labor.  This estimate is contingent on completing the deal prior t=\no=20\nDec 31,2000.  If a deal is made after Dec 31, 2000 then the higher cost=20\nestimate applies.\n\nMonroe #1 TBS Mods / Pressure Increase\nThe Monroe #1 TBS Mods Project was released to Engineering.   The project w=\nas=20\nthe result of WIGas raising the IT load by approximately 4000 mcf/day.  The=\ny=20\nalso requested a pressure increase at the station from 80 psig to 275=20\npsig.    A Form 2476 \"Pressure Increase Request Form\" is being circulated f=\nor=20\nsignature.  The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The=\n=20\nmodifications consist of replacing both meters with spool pieces and=20\nperforming a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP.\n\nMilbank Project\nContinued gathering data to model the Milbank system as it is today.\n\nMelbourne #1 - Project Release\nThe Melbourne #1 TBS Mods project was released to Engineering.   The projec=\nt=20\nconsists of TBS mods to support the increase of firm from 330 mcf/day to 50=\n0=20\nmcf/day at Melbourne. Presently the Marshalltown B/L is constrained and cou=\nld=20\nnot support the incremental firm.  Alliant will realign gas away from the=\n=20\nMarshalltown #1 TBS which is at the end of this B/L to the Marshalltown #1A=\n=20\nTBS which is on a different B/L.  This will open up capacity on the line fo=\nr=20\nthis new load.   The project has a targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date. =\n=20\nModifications consist of replacing the first and second cut regulators and=\n=20\nreplacing the meter.\n\nAdel #1A TBS Mods - project release\nThe Adel #1A TBS Mods Project was released to engineering.  This project wa=\ns=20\na result of the customer wanting to convert an existing IT load at Adel #1A=\n=20\nto a Firm load.  The new Firm load will be 1400 mcf/day.   The project has =\na=20\ntargeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The station will have a new meter=\n=20\ninstalled along with piping size modifications.\n\nEthanol Injection\nReviewed and researched (for Marketing) the possibility of injecting Ethano=\nl=20\ninto the pipeline for a possible \"Green Energy\" rating and as a means of BT=\nU=20\nenhancement.  Since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline=20\nconditions, even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not=\n=20\ninsure the Ethanol from liquefying, dropping out and collecting into the=20\npipeline low spots.  Also, there were many issues concerning possible liqui=\nds=20\nentering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers=01, equipmen=\nt. =20\nPlanning recommended that this project not be pursued.\n\nResearched (for Marketing) was the possibility of burning a Methane/Ethanol=\n=20\nmix in our equipment (i.e.: Turbines) in order to receive a \"Green Power\"=\n=20\nrating.  Solar was contacted concerning the possibility of \"co-burning\"=20\nethanol and methane.  As a manufacturer they said they would be willing to=\n=20\nwork with us, however, they only recommended it if it were to be a constant=\n=20\nfuel source.  Solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system=\n=20\nretrofits required.  Also, if this were not a constant fuel then there woul=\nd=20\nhave to be two separate fuel systems (co-burn and methane only) and a=20\ncomplete fuel control system change.  With all that the project has been=20\ndeemed cost prohibitive.\n\nVapor Injection of Propane (VIP Service)\nResearch was started for Marketing into the possibility of injecting=20\nvaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity during=\n=20\npeak days.  Upon initial review many questions were generated by the planni=\nng=20\nteam concerning specific requirements of the new service (i.e.: # of days/y=\nr,=20\nfirm, daily firm etc.)  Planning awaits feedback from Marketing before any=\n=20\nmore action is taken.\n\nElectric Generation=20\nProposal was reviewed for Marketing from APA for an engineering study to=20\nreview the possibility of utilizing stand-by generators as electric produce=\nrs=20\nfor the Utilities during peak power times in the summer months.  A few=20\ndiscrepancies were found and are being worked out before APA can be release=\nd=20\nto complete the engineering study.\n\nBeaver Dehy\nA request was received from John Sturn of the optimization team to review t=\nhe=20\nCapacity of the Mole sieve Dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the =\nSE=20\n24\" line.  Beaver is considering a capital project to re-route the dehy=20\nsystem that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the=20\ndischarge, thus increasing the capacity. =20\n\nCogentrix Power Plant\nThree detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were=\n=20\nprepared and forwarded to Marketing.  The details of the cost estimate=20\nincluded a breakdown of costs for:\nMaterial Costs\nLabor\nFreight and Taxes\nSurveys/Permits\nConstruction Support\nDistrict Labor\nEngineering/Drafting/As-builts\nContingency\nOverhead\nAFUDC\nThe break down of costs was done for the Sheldon, Lehigh, and Raun projects=\n=20\nin Nebraska and Iowa.\n\nCherokee Ethanol Projects\nSeven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in Cherokee County,=\n=20\nIowa.  The delivery volume was for 8 MMCF/D at a delivery pressure of 70=20\npsig.  It was assumed for this study that the initial load would be for 4=\n=20\nMMCF/D for two years and then increase to the 8 MMCF/D level.  The cost=20\nestimate assumed that the initial design would be for the 8 MMCF/D.  This w=\nas=20\ndone to reduce the cost for the project.  Each cost estimate was done for a=\n=20\nfirm transport level and an interruptible transport level (14 cost estimate=\ns=20\ntotal).  Two of the sites are on the C line approximately 10 miles southwes=\nt=20\nof the Paullina Station.  The remaining sites were on the Storm Lake/Lytton=\n=20\nBranchline.",

State unemployment claims for week ended Saturday\n(Previous: +8,000 at 419,000; Forecast: 411,000)\n\n10:00 AM ET. April wholesale trade (March: inventories +0.1%, sales\n-1.2%)\n\n2:30 PM ET. Treasury announces size of 13- and 26-week bills.\n\n3:00 PM ET. April consumer credit (March: +$6.2 billion; Forecast:\n+$8.5 billion)\n\n4:30 PM ET. Money supply statistics.\n\nKEY HEADLINES:\n\nSterling plunges to fresh 15-year low against the Dollar.\n\nCendant near $3-billion deal to acquire Galileo, says report.\n\nJury orders Philip Morris to pay $3 billion to lifelong smoker.\n\nPresident Bush announces resumption of US-North Korea talks.\n\nChateau to buy Security Cap Group's CWS unit for $570 million.\n\nCostco Wholesale May same-store sales up 6%.\n\nHP sees IT slowdown spreading; cautious on revenue outlook.\n\nWells Fargo sees second quarter $1.13 billion non-cash charge.\n\nIRAQ: Iraqi Press: US to modify proposal for \"smart\" sanctions.\n\nJapan's trade minister regrets US probe into steel imports.\n\nGerman May unemployment up 18,000; sharply above forecasts.\n\nUS says no deadline for troop withdrawal from Balkans.\n\nThe STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS\n\nThe NASDAQ and S&P 500 were steady to lower overnight due to light\nprofit taking as investors used cautious comments from Hewlett-\nPackard and J.P. Morgan as an excuse to take some money off the table\nafter a four-day run on Wednesday. Both the Nasdaq and Sept. S&P\nremain range bound and will need to close above May's high or below\nlast week's lows to clear up near-term direction in the markets.\nMeanwhile, the Dow posted an inside day with a lower close on\nWednesday as it consolidated some of its gains off last Friday's low.\nHowever, momentum indicators have turned neutral to bullish signaling\nthat additional gains during June are possible. If there are no major\nsurprises in this morning's unemployment report, I am looking for the\nDow to trade steady to higher today.\n\nEuropean markets were mixed in overnight trading as German\nunemployment for May was well above expectations that led to a modest\nsetback in the DAX-30. The UK FTSE-100 was up 17.00 points at 5918.50\nwhile the German DAX-30 was down 12.06 points at 6180.38 as of 11:00\nBST.\n\nThe Nikkei closed higher overnight as investors were encouraged by\nbetter-than-expected April machinery orders data. Overnight gains led\nto the posting of an upside reversal as the Nikkei consolidates above\nthe 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995. Additional gains on\nFriday are needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern, which\nwould increase the odds that a short-term bottom may be in place.\nMomentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish\nhinting that a short-term bottom might be in or near.

A lower close during the day session\nwould increase the odds that this week's bounce has come to an end.\nCloses below Monday's low would open the door for additional weakness\nand could lead to a test of weekly support crossing at 74.10 later\nthis spring. It will take closes above 77.20 to temper the near-term\nbearish outlook in the market. Momentum indicators are neutral to\nbearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into early-June\nappears are still possible.\n\nGRAINS\n\nJuly corn was higher overnight due to hot/dry conditions in eastern\nChina's key crop producing region are gaining increased attention\nfrom the market.

However, traders have indicated that these\nconditions are of little concern at this point in the growing season.\nThis morning's export sales report will provide near-term direction\nfor the market. Pre-report estimates range from 850,000 to 1 million\nmetric tonnes. Wednesday's upside reversal hinted that the pause\nabove broken trendline resistance might be coming to an end.

Early calls are for July corn\nto open 1 to 1 1/4 cents higher this morning.\n\nJuly wheat was higher in overnight trading due to hot/dry conditions\nacross China, which has lead to some yield reduction of their hard\nred winter wheat crop. Overnight gains were limited as the wheat\nharvest has moved into southern Oklahoma and is accelerating. Early\nyield results are fair however, protein levels are coming in better\nthan expected.

Some traders believe that the USDA will actually\nraise their export projection of soybeans for this year in the\nupcoming June supply/demand report.

Momentum indicators remain bullish but are entering their\nrespective overbought zones warning bulls to use caution as a\nshort-term top might be near.\n\nAugust cattle closed lower on Wednesday and in doing so turned a\nnumber of momentum indicators bearish from overbought levels\nsignaling that a broad double top with January's high might be in\nplace.

Morgan as an excuse to take some money off the table\nafter a four-day run on Wednesday. Both the Nasdaq and Sept. S&P\nremain range bound and will need to close above May's high or below\nlast week's lows to clear up near-term direction in the markets.\nMeanwhile, the Dow posted an inside day with a lower close on\nWednesday as it consolidated some of its gains off last Friday's low.\nHowever, momentum indicators have turned neutral to bullish signaling\nthat additional gains during June are possible.

Closes above 60.80 are needed to temper the near-term bearish\noutlook in the market.\n\nJuly cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a lower close as it\nconsolidated some of this week's short covering gains. July remains\nbelow broken trading range support crossing at 955 leaving the door\nopen for sideways to lower trading if Monday's low is exceeded.\nHowever, momentum indicators are becoming oversold warning bears to\nuse caution when pressing the short side of the market.\n\nJuly sugar posted a key reversal down on Wednesday hinting that the\nshort covering bounce off last week's double bottom might have come\nto an end. Additional weakness on Thursday is needed to confirm\ntoday's bearish reversal pattern. Momentum indicators are bearish\nsignaling that a resumption of May's decline is possible. If the\ndecline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.\n\nJuly cotton closed higher on Wednesday keeping the short covering\nbounce off last week's low alive for the time being. However, July\nneeds to close above this year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95\nto confirm that a bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum\nindicators are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher\nprices near-term are possible.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nRe: The Golden Secret Of Price, Time And Market Symmetry\nhttp://store.ino.com/private/1A433/TWPD-GOLDEN\n\n\nDear Andrew:\n\nSee How One Trader Averages A Documented . . .\n\n$42,704 PROFIT PER MONTH\n\n. . .

While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:\n\t1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.\n\t2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.\n\n\tThe OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.\n\n\tAt this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.\n\tIt is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.   \n\tLarson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.\n\tAmb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.\n\n\tLast, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.  \n\n ",

A summary of the meeting follows:\n\nThe main debate in the meeting was with respect to whether \"physical\" \ntransactions were possible in Ontario given the market rules.  Ontario Power \nGeneration Inc. (OPG) put forth the premise that all transactions involving \nthe pool are financial.  I led the charge that the pool was simply a \nsettlement mechanism yet the underlying transactions are physical in nature.  \nOPG supported a  form of master which essentially a much boiled down ISDA.  I \nsupported the Canadianized EEI form that Greg has put together.\nJack Lubec of the IMO made a powerpoint presentation on how transactions are \nsettled and his interpretation of the physical/financial issue.  A copy of \nthe presentation is attached hereto.\nThe group (which included TransCanada, TransAlta, AMPCO (industrials), Hydro \nOne (transco), the IMO, several consultants and lawyers) seemed unable to \nagree with either position and decided that the market in Ontario was a \nhybrid market (a position that in practice may be correct but in terms of \nlegal obligations is nonsensical).\nThe IMO advised that Revenue Canada does not take title to power, does not \ntake possession of power and the pool transactions are deemed not \n\"derivatives\".  Notwithstanding this direction, some in the group seemed to \naccept the OPG assertion that as a generator can choose not to generate (in \nwhich case the pool will supply on the generator's behalf and charge the \ngenerator) and/or a would be load can choose not to receive (in which case \nthe pool treats this as a resale to the pool and pays the load for energy not \nconsumed) and that a supplier has no ability to guarantee physical delivery \nthat the market is financial.  I refuted this premise but only found support \nfrom TransAlta.\nNotwithstanding the lack of consensus on the physical/financial issue the \ngroup did agree with my position that many market participants did not have \nthe requisite corporate authority to do derivative or financial transactions \nand those that did may not be comfortable with or even understand a financial \ntrading document.  All in the group supported this position.  Thus,it is \nlikely that the starting point, if not the Enron Canada EEI form, will be the \nbase EEI form.  Many supported an Ontario only document but accepted the \nposition if possible a multi-jurisdictional standard base agreement would be \npreferred.\n The group tentatively accepted me and Dan Pastoric of Hydro One as the \nco-chairs of the drafting committee.  This is subject to confirmation at the \nnext meeting which is scheduled for December 6th.\n\nElizabeth - I suggest that you and I may want to prepare some sort of memo \nsetting out why the market is physical and not financial.  I think that to \nthe extent that you (or someone in your group) can provide a commentary why \nothers pools (California, NEPOOL,...) are still physical markets, I may be \nbetter equipped to convince the group. \n\nGreg - I suggest that until we are closer to market opening in Ontario that \nthe form of power master that we circulate in Alberta not include the Ontario \nFirm (LD) product definition as this will likely be modified through the \nOSPBC process.\n\nRegards\nCJG",

As part of that Docket, several transmission lines \nwere denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to \nfurther support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   \nOn March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting \nreclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  \nThe newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, \nH-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, \nCNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective \nApril 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff \nsheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff \nsheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel \nretention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have \nquestions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at \n(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.\n\nApril 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00  \n11:10 am\n                                                              Posted 4/3/00  \n11:10 am\n\nDear Pool Operator:\n\n CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings \nExtraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance \nstarting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires \nthat the \"wet gas\" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  \nThe plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no \nunexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations \nare scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions \nconcerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed \nto CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.\n\n Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets \nother than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. \non Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations \nto pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight \nand will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per \nCNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT \nconsidering \nthe gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your \npool.\n\n As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult \nto determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your \npool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's \nlocal operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators \nnotify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify \nproducers individually.\n\n We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted \nto you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us \nto avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled \nshut       down will not be until 2002.\n\n If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to \ncontact me at (304) 623-8698. \n\n      Sincerely,\n\n\n\n      Nancy M.

As part of that Docket, several transmission lines \nwere denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to \nfurther support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   \nOn March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting \nreclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  \nThe newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, \nH-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, \nCNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective \nApril 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff \nsheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff \nsheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel \nretention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have \nquestions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at \n(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.\n\nApril 3, 2000                                                Received 4/3/00  \n11:10 am\n                                                              Posted 4/3/00  \n11:10 am\n\nDear Pool Operator:\n\n CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings \nExtraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance \nstarting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires \nthat the \"wet gas\" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  \nThe plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no \nunexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations \nare scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions \nconcerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed \nto CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.\n\n Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets \nother than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. \non Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations \nto pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight \nand will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per \nCNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT \nconsidering \nthe gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your \npool.\n\n As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult \nto determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your \npool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's \nlocal operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators \nnotify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify \nproducers individually.\n\n We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted \nto you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us \nto avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled \nshut       down will not be until 2002.\n\n If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to \ncontact me at (304) 623-8698.",

Please select the \"Read Only\" option in order to open and \nprint.  Please print 2 originals for signature so each party has an original \nexecuted NDA, or you may e-mail it to them as long as they follow up with 2 \noriginals.

On that basis, Chris Bell is the best candidate.\n\nThe Observer has endorsed Bell before, when he was running for council. He\nis probably the most intelligent of the three major contenders.

He supports a vote on any\nexpansion to Metro's light rail system, although he wisely does not support\nstopping the seven-mile project that is already begun. His focus is the\ntaxpayer as the customer, and the customer drives the services.\n\nHe sees the big picture and has the intelligence to lead wisely. He is not\nfavored by either political party, a good thing in our opinion, and points\nout that in this time of national crisis, leaders who can bring diverse\nneeds and people together will be the best leader.\n\nBell's major opponent did vote for annexation.

International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us reports and interviews throughout the day. \n\nWashington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says they'll continue to bring us the very latest on energy legislation and how it's progressing. The bureau will also have updates on the anthrax scare in Washington. Congressional office buildings were closed on Tuesday, but there's a possibility some could reopen as soon as Wednesday. \n\nThe Washington bureau will also cover Wednesday's FERC meeting as commissioners meet for the first time since the end of the weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations. Peter says new proposals for developing RTOs in the Northeast and Southeast are among the issues on the FERC's agenda. \n\nDyonyx CEO Fred Pratt will talk with the Houston bureau about how companies can make current technologies work better for them. Dyonyx is a privately held information technology and management-consulting firm. Join us for the Pratt interview from the Houston bureau on Wednesday. \n\nWe'll also get a Texas PUC update on Wednesday. ENL's Gale Smith says we'll find out what electric providers are doing to increase security and what the Texas PUC is doing to monitor emergency preparedness in Texas.

International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us reports and interviews throughout the day. \n\nWashington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says they'll continue to bring us the very latest on energy legislation and how it's progressing. The bureau will also have updates on the anthrax scare in Washington. Congressional office buildings were closed on Tuesday, but there's a possibility some could reopen as soon as Wednesday. \n\nThe Washington bureau will also cover Wednesday's FERC meeting as commissioners meet for the first time since the end of the weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations. Peter says new proposals for developing RTOs in the Northeast and Southeast are among the issues on the FERC's agenda. \n\nDyonyx CEO Fred Pratt will talk with the Houston bureau about how companies can make current technologies work better for them. Dyonyx is a privately held information technology and management-consulting firm. Join us for the Pratt interview from the Houston bureau on Wednesday. \n\nWe'll also get a Texas PUC update on Wednesday. ENL's Gale Smith says we'll find out what electric providers are doing to increase security and what the Texas PUC is doing to monitor emergency preparedness in Texas. Be sure to catch all this from the Houston bureau tomorrow. \n\nCalifornia Power Authority Chairman S.

The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of \nthe Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving \nthe project forward.\n\nCaithness Corporation\nCaithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety \nof business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for \nprivate investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of \ngeneration through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind \nin Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina \njointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.\n\nBig Sandy Project\nThe Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, \nArizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 \nMW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another \n170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.\n\nThe proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of \nTranswestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near \nvalve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station \n#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state \nhighway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of \nSection 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV \ntransmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one \nof the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends \nfrom the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've \nincluded a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a \nwater pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant \nwill come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have \ncurrently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power \nplant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the \nwells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface \nwater from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the \nCyprus Bagdad water pipeline.\n\nThe chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and \nassociated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area \nincludes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited \nagricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an \nestimated population of 200.\n\nProject Schedule\nGas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000\nSubmit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000\nArrange financing     December 2000\nEIS approval      March 2001\nConstruction begins     April 2001\nTesting begins      July 2002\nCommercial Operation     November 2002\n\nThere are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of \nLand Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power \nAdministration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known \nto be present in the area.\n\nLateral Pipeline Alignment\nThe most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The \nalignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed \nnext month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department \nof Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement \nfor the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right \nof way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only \na 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines \nrequire a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent \nright of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this \nalignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.\n\nIf the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second \nalternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section \nline.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the \nrouting would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly \nnecessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve \nfollowing along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue \nthere, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is \nwhether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high \npressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.\n\nOther Preliminary Project Issues\nThere are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to \ninterconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern \nmainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both \nof which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original \nestimate to construct a 16\" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was \nbased on the following specifications:\n\n120 MMcf/d\n450 psig delivery pressure,\n900 psig inlet pressure\n\nThe meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a \nhigher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse \nturbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at \na pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate \nEPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the \ndesign will likely change to a 20\" pipeline.\n\nNext Steps (responsible party/department)\n Task      Date Due Party/Dept. \nPipeline Alignment\n1. Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route.     8/4  Matthews/Chanley\n2. Engineering services agreement    8/4  Scott/Fawcett\n3. Final alignment sheets.    8/25  Matthews/Chanley\n\nMisc. Items\n1.

Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction. \n\nWe'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate. There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor. \n\nAlso in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants. We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday. \n\nHouston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor. Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area. On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies. We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow. \n\nWe'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas. South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America. \n\nAlso from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter. Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast. \n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday. West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access. \n\nKym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity. This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world. Kym will bring us details on Thursday. \n\nFinally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15. Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow. \n\nFrom ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings. And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings. Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow. \n\nKeep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. \n\nBe sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour. \n\n \t \n \t   <http://www.energynewslive.com/content/email/graphics/signature.jpg>\t \t \n \t Jay Rickerts, EnergyNewsLive.com Anchor\n\nView today's Energy Wrap video <http://www.energynewslive.com/NavController?referer=email.jsp&acti on=dailyWrap&email=Mike.Grigsby@enron.com> \n(Requires Windows Media Player <http://www.microsoft.com/windows/mediaplayer/en/download/Win32IE4x 86.asp> or Real Player <http://www.real.com>) \n\nExperience all that Williams Energy News Live has to offer! <http://www.energynewslive.com>\n\nIf you are receiving this letter for the first time and wish to continue,\nsubscribe now <mailto:join-enl-members-html@estutenws11.energy.williams.com> \n\nTo stop receiving this letter, unsubscribe now <http://www.energynewslive.com/unsubscribe.jsp?type=H&email=$subst( 'Recip.EmailAddr')> \n\nIf you are having trouble receiving this e-mail, please let us know <mailto:ecenter@energynewslive.com> or call\n(800) WILLIAMS (800-945-5426) weekdays, 7am-7pm CST. \n\nComments?

We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. \n\nThis information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for \"reverse synergies.\"  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.\n\nI don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  \n\nPlease let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  \n\nJayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.\t\n\nThank you,\nSarah\nx36214\n << File: TW model 11.20.xls >> ",

They don't quite understand the business but we need to be able to break the variouss vol;umes aprt to be able to get this moving.\n\nJan if you are here today can I get you to help me out with some info.\tThe most important thing I need is actual volumetric data going back and projected as far out as you have it.    You can see the splits between the gallup volumes, red rock and the pre existing deals.   I also need to verify the capacity added from the expansions.   Also need to begin to detail the volumes from Long term firm contract versus short term deals including IT etc.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tTaylor, Sarah  \nSent:\tWednesday, November 21, 2001 12:06 AM\nTo:\tHayslett, Rod\nCc:\tDesai, Jayshree; 'jaysandesai@yahoo.com'; 'sdesai@idriveonline.com'; Taylor, Sarah\nSubject:\tAdditional TW information request\n\nRod,\n\nFollowing our conversations today it appears necessary to include more granular information in the transwestern model.  We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. \n\nThis information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for \"reverse synergies.\"  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.\n\nI don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  \n\nPlease let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  \n\nJayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.\t\n\nThank you,\nSarah\nx36214\n << File: TW model 11.20.xls >>",

All users will need to be logged off during this tim=\ne period.  If this is not possible, contact Adam DeRidder (x3-1428) or Carl=\nos Uribe (x5-8179) as soon as possible.\n=09In order to validate the migration, production users need to test access=\n to their home directories and applications on Saturday, October 7 and Sund=\nay, October 8, 2001.\n\n=09As part of the migration plan, the Storage Team needs volunteers from th=\ne production community to test the new environment.  The test will only req=\nuire approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.  Adam DeRidder and Carlos Uri=\nbe have setup a test lab on the 34th floor for this purpose.  Contact Adam =\nto setup a time.  Your involvement will help make this a successful migrati=\non.\n\n=09A list of contacts will be made available on Thursday, October 5, 2001. =\n Please use this list to report issues and check the status of the migratio=\nn.\n\nBob Ambrocik\nEnterprise Storage Team\nEB 3429F\nx5-4577\nbob.ambrocik@enron.com",

This will require travel at noon on the 16th and \nan overnight stay that night.    We will fly back on the 17th.  This meeting \nis designed to get to personally know some of their staff and understand what \ntheir job entails.   There will be a team building exercise and a brief \npresentation on forward trading.\n\nI have modified the schedule to handle this meeting,  as I plan on having \nfive Real Timers attend.    I have selected attendees based upon , first of \nall,  the existing work schedule.    I have also  taken into consideration \nwhether an employee has recently attended offsites or will be attending \ntraining soon.\nIn other words,  I am trying to get everyone a chance to travel.\n\nThis is short notice,  so I need to be contacted by anyone that either cannot \ntravel or cannot accomodate the changes in the work schedule.  (You should \nhave a creative reason why).\nMost of the modifications I propose should be favorable to those affected, in \nmy opinion.    Let me know if you feel otherwise.\n\nStewart Rosman and Deborah will be making travel arrangements for our \ngroup.      \n\nI can be reached by cell phone 503-701-6728,  as I will be in E-tag training \nclass.

    "body_text": "Greetings -\n\nWe have scheduled a meeting with the ISO Dispatchers in Sacramento on the \nevening of November 16th.   This will require travel at noon on the 16th and \nan overnight stay that night.    We will fly back on the 17th.  This meeting \nis designed to get to personally know some of their staff and understand what \ntheir job entails.   There will be a team building exercise and a brief \npresentation on forward trading.\n\nI have modified the schedule to handle this meeting,  as I plan on having \nfive Real Timers attend.    I have selected attendees based upon , first of \nall,  the existing work schedule.    I have also  taken into consideration \nwhether an employee has recently attended offsites or will be attending \ntraining soon.\nIn other words,  I am trying to get everyone a chance to travel.\n\nThis is short notice,  so I need to be contacted by anyone that either cannot \ntravel or cannot accomodate the changes in the work schedule.  (You should \nhave a creative reason why).\nMost of the modifications I propose should be favorable to those affected, in \nmy opinion.    Let me know if you feel otherwise.\n\nStewart Rosman and Deborah will be making travel arrangements for our \ngroup.      \n\nI can be reached by cell phone 503-701-6728,  as I will be in E-tag training \nclass.

Based on a recent decision (March 16, 2001) in Columbia Gas T=\nransmission Co,  I think we can.  In Columbia, the Commission approved Colu=\nmbia's proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm c=\napacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one=\n hour period from 7:00 am to 8:00 a.m.   Capacity offered for one year or m=\nore would be subject to an initial posting period of  5 days.     This indi=\ncates movement by the Commission to much shorter posting periods for capaci=\nty available for less than one year.  I think we can modify our procedures =\nto include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category.  However, we may w=\nant to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 =\nday category for capacity offered for less than one year.    In addition, f=\nor capacity offered for one year or more, Columbia will advertise a propose=\nd offer on its EBB one day prior to the five-day posting of the capacity.  =\n(This supports a special posting in advance.)   Although it is good to have=\n these internal procedures, what is important to the Commission is that pip=\neline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of c=\napacity. =20\n\nThe Columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bi=\nd for max rates.

    "body_text": "Pursuant to our meeting, I was to check the posting timelines to see if we =\ncould make the 1 day category, include 5 months or less rather than less th=\nan 5 months.  Based on a recent decision (March 16, 2001) in Columbia Gas T=\nransmission Co,  I think we can.  In Columbia, the Commission approved Colu=\nmbia's proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm c=\napacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one=\n hour period from 7:00 am to 8:00 a.m.   Capacity offered for one year or m=\nore would be subject to an initial posting period of  5 days.     This indi=\ncates movement by the Commission to much shorter posting periods for capaci=\nty available for less than one year.  I think we can modify our procedures =\nto include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category.  However, we may w=\nant to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 =\nday category for capacity offered for less than one year.    In addition, f=\nor capacity offered for one year or more, Columbia will advertise a propose=\nd offer on its EBB one day prior to the five-day posting of the capacity.  =\n(This supports a special posting in advance.)   Although it is good to have=\n these internal procedures, what is important to the Commission is that pip=\neline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of c=\napacity. =20\n\nThe Columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bi=\nd for max rates.     Columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capa=\ncity to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months=\n until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auctio=\nn package.  The Commission rejected this in favor of the Industrials' propo=\nsal:  Beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service, Colum=\nbia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than=\n 12 months.  Beginning seven days before the capacity is available, Columbi=\na must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less th=\na 5 months.

As background, I have been at EECC since \nOctober last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint \nventure agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing \nagreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic \ninvestment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston \noffice of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where \nI focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on \ntheir transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and \nCFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP \nprojects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in \nWashington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions \nsuch as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, \npartnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.

The\nadditional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through 2004,\nbut also includes Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nAt the same time, concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being\nexacerbated by Germany's plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power.\n\nANALYSIS: If FT Energy's projections for necessary generation additions\nin Europe are accurate, I think there are some real challenges that the\nContinent will face in reaching this goal. First off, for perspective,\nlet's be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming\nEurope will need by 2005. The figure of 69,000 MW is roughly equivalent\nto the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system\nin Texas. When we consider also that the United States consumes about double\nthe amount of power that Europe consumes, the projection that Europe will\nneed an additional 69,000 MW of new generating capacity is a staggering\nproposition.\n\nGranted, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption\nhas grown over the last two years. According to data included in its report,\nFT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from 2,409 \nterrawatt-hours\n(TWh) in 1998 to 2,446 TWh in 1999, an increase of about 1.5 percent per\nyear. While this may seem like a minimal increase, it is important to note\nthat in some European markets growth has exceeded that average. For instance,\nestimated new capacity additions through 2005 are mainly concentrated in\nSpain, France, Germany and Sweden. The growth in demand, coupled with market\nliberalization, has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction\nor purchase of generation assets.\n\nAlthough reportedly 60 percent of the electricity market across Europe\nhas been liberalized to date, the Continent remains rather disjointed as\nit is composed of 16 national markets that are all approaching privatization\nat different speeds. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their\nprivatization movements in the early 1990s. Spain required its state-owned\nutility companies to begin divesting their assets in February 1999, a process\nthat will continue through 2007. Germany decided to open 100 percent of\nits market all at once in April 1998. And France resisted efforts to \nprivatize,\nand only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European\nUnion. Consequently, although Europe may in fact need the 69,000 MW of\nnew generating capacity that FT Energy has projected, the type and extent\nto which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on\nthe energy policy of each independent nation. A variety of restrictions\nmay be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount\nof capacity.\n\nEach European country is developing its own policy toward privatization\nand, by extension, its approach to generation development. I can't examine\nthe policy of each country in this forum, but I think a look at Germany\nis warranted, both because it is a major component of Europe's total energy\nmarket and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact\nthe Continent as a whole.\n\nGermany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation,\ndue to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened\nto competition. It follows that generation coming from Germany should \ncontribute\na large percentage of the Continent's future power needs. However, a large\npercentage of Germany's power has come from nuclear power, but that has\nall changed over the last year. After the Social Democratic Party formed\na coalition with the antinuclear Green Party, nuclear energy became an\nunacceptable energy source. The German government has essentially put a\nmoratorium on nuclear power, and in fact decided to eventually shut down\n19 nuclear power plants in the country. Just last month, Germany's two\nlargest power producers, RWE AG and E.ON AG, announced plans to cut output\nfrom their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has\ndeveloped since Germany liberalized its market. The measures amount to\na reduction of about 10 percent in Germany's overall power generating \ncapacity.\n\n\nMoreover, nuclear energy has generated over one-third of Germany's nearly\n500 billion kilowatt-hours of annual electricity demand, and one-third\nof Western Europe's total electricity supply. As the future of nuclear\npower in Germany looks rather dim, big questions surround what will replace\nnuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europe's\nenergy industry.\n\nCoal currently produces about 50 percent of the power generation in Germany,\nbut as a result of the country's attempts to lower emissions, coal also\nappears to be on a decline. Also, in Germany, as in the rest of Europe,\ncoal-industry subsidies will come to an end as early as 2005, making it\nless economical to invest in coal-fired plants. At the same time, other\ncountries like France are exploring clean-coal technologies, but it is\nquestionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand\nacross the Continent.\n\nGenerally, natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will\ntake the place of nuclear power in Europe, given the seemingly abundant\nsupplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea. However, as demand\nacross other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases, this may\nimpact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe. In addition, there\nare no effective rules across Europe for third-party access to private\npipeline grids, also putting into question the future of natural-gas supplies.\nAlso, as we have seen in the United States, as demand for natural gas \nincreases,\nso will the prices, which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary\npower source.\n\nAs a result, much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable\nenergy. In fact, the German government wants to double renewable energy\noutput to 10 percent of total energy demand by 2010, using such forms as\nhydroelectric and wind power. This seems consistent with what the rest\nof Europe is doing. The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate\n10 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2010. Scandinavian\ncountries already have become predominantly based in renewable and \nlow-emission\nforms of energy, with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of\nthe Nordic region's total electricity production.\n\nWind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western\nEurope, with projects in Germany, Denmark and Spain ranking among the \nfastest-growing\nin the world. Again, according to the U.S. DOE, wind power is projected\nto grow by 1.9 percent per year in Western Europe. This growth prospective\nis pretty dismal, and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will\nbe sufficient to meet the demand in Europe. Renewable energy works fine\nwhen planning overall energy needs, but it rarely can be relied on to meet\npeak demand. The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to\nand the sun shines when it wants to, which can make peak planning based\non renewable energy difficult if not impossible. This being the case, many\ncritics say Europe's current move toward renewable energy is completely\nunrealistic, arguing that it would take nearly 2,000 wind turbines to equal\none nuclear plant. In addition, the growth for renewable energy is plotted\nover the course of ten to fifteen years. FT Energy marks the year 2005\nas the point at which Europe will need the additional 69,000 MW of generating\ncapacity.\n\nIn addition, despite the fact that coal-fired generation poses pollution\nproblems, it is still a comparatively low-cost form of generation. This\nwill make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence\nof a strong worldwide commitment. The U.S. Department of Energy projects\nonly a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of\nenergy through 2020, just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain\na slim 8-percent share of the total world energy consumption.\n\nSo what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for\nnew generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources\nthat could help the Continent to reach its supply needs? First, keep in\nmind that I've focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role\nin Europe as a whole. However, the restrictions on nuclear power are not\nnecessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries. For\ninstance, the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by\nopening a plant in Temelin. The question is, without Germany's contribution\nof nuclear power, will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other\npower sources and other countries? Although the 69,000 MW goal seems very\nambitious, Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use\nof merchant plants. As competition continues, wholesale power buyers are\ndemanding shorter-term contracts, which in turn is supporting a growing\ntrend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent. Presently, only\nthe United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power, but there\nare signs that the trend is extending to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,\nand even Germany. In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear\npower, merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europe's\nnatural-gas market. Yet, as we have seen in California, the plant siting\nprocess offers its own array of regulatory hurdles, and it is not clear\nif European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries.\nPlus, the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily \nnatural-gas\nfired, which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source.\n\nMoreover, just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter\ndue to our own brand of energy supply problems, we are finding that the\nproblem is not limited to our part of the world. It is, of course, unknown\nif Europe will meet its additional supply projections of 69,000 MW by 2005.\nYet, at the same time, it is clear that demand on the Continent continues\nto rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline.\n===============================================================\nLearn more about SCIENTECH's Issues and Analysis products and services\nat:\nhttp://www.consultrci.com/web/rciweb.nsf/web/Depts-IA.html\n==============================================================\n\nSCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

The\nadditional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through 2004,\nbut also includes Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nAt the same time, concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being\nexacerbated by Germany's plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power.\n\nANALYSIS: If FT Energy's projections for necessary generation additions\nin Europe are accurate, I think there are some real challenges that the\nContinent will face in reaching this goal. First off, for perspective,\nlet's be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming\nEurope will need by 2005. The figure of 69,000 MW is roughly equivalent\nto the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system\nin Texas. When we consider also that the United States consumes about double\nthe amount of power that Europe consumes, the projection that Europe will\nneed an additional 69,000 MW of new generating capacity is a staggering\nproposition.\n\nGranted, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption\nhas grown over the last two years. According to data included in its report,\nFT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from 2,409 \nterrawatt-hours\n(TWh) in 1998 to 2,446 TWh in 1999, an increase of about 1.5 percent per\nyear. While this may seem like a minimal increase, it is important to note\nthat in some European markets growth has exceeded that average. For instance,\nestimated new capacity additions through 2005 are mainly concentrated in\nSpain, France, Germany and Sweden. The growth in demand, coupled with market\nliberalization, has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction\nor purchase of generation assets.\n\nAlthough reportedly 60 percent of the electricity market across Europe\nhas been liberalized to date, the Continent remains rather disjointed as\nit is composed of 16 national markets that are all approaching privatization\nat different speeds. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their\nprivatization movements in the early 1990s. Spain required its state-owned\nutility companies to begin divesting their assets in February 1999, a process\nthat will continue through 2007. Germany decided to open 100 percent of\nits market all at once in April 1998. And France resisted efforts to \nprivatize,\nand only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European\nUnion. Consequently, although Europe may in fact need the 69,000 MW of\nnew generating capacity that FT Energy has projected, the type and extent\nto which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on\nthe energy policy of each independent nation. A variety of restrictions\nmay be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount\nof capacity.\n\nEach European country is developing its own policy toward privatization\nand, by extension, its approach to generation development. I can't examine\nthe policy of each country in this forum, but I think a look at Germany\nis warranted, both because it is a major component of Europe's total energy\nmarket and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact\nthe Continent as a whole.\n\nGermany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation,\ndue to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened\nto competition. It follows that generation coming from Germany should \ncontribute\na large percentage of the Continent's future power needs. However, a large\npercentage of Germany's power has come from nuclear power, but that has\nall changed over the last year. After the Social Democratic Party formed\na coalition with the antinuclear Green Party, nuclear energy became an\nunacceptable energy source. The German government has essentially put a\nmoratorium on nuclear power, and in fact decided to eventually shut down\n19 nuclear power plants in the country. Just last month, Germany's two\nlargest power producers, RWE AG and E.ON AG, announced plans to cut output\nfrom their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has\ndeveloped since Germany liberalized its market. The measures amount to\na reduction of about 10 percent in Germany's overall power generating \ncapacity.\n\n\nMoreover, nuclear energy has generated over one-third of Germany's nearly\n500 billion kilowatt-hours of annual electricity demand, and one-third\nof Western Europe's total electricity supply. As the future of nuclear\npower in Germany looks rather dim, big questions surround what will replace\nnuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europe's\nenergy industry.\n\nCoal currently produces about 50 percent of the power generation in Germany,\nbut as a result of the country's attempts to lower emissions, coal also\nappears to be on a decline. Also, in Germany, as in the rest of Europe,\ncoal-industry subsidies will come to an end as early as 2005, making it\nless economical to invest in coal-fired plants. At the same time, other\ncountries like France are exploring clean-coal technologies, but it is\nquestionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand\nacross the Continent.\n\nGenerally, natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will\ntake the place of nuclear power in Europe, given the seemingly abundant\nsupplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea. However, as demand\nacross other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases, this may\nimpact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe. In addition, there\nare no effective rules across Europe for third-party access to private\npipeline grids, also putting into question the future of natural-gas supplies.\nAlso, as we have seen in the United States, as demand for natural gas \nincreases,\nso will the prices, which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary\npower source.\n\nAs a result, much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable\nenergy. In fact, the German government wants to double renewable energy\noutput to 10 percent of total energy demand by 2010, using such forms as\nhydroelectric and wind power. This seems consistent with what the rest\nof Europe is doing. The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate\n10 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2010. Scandinavian\ncountries already have become predominantly based in renewable and \nlow-emission\nforms of energy, with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of\nthe Nordic region's total electricity production.\n\nWind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western\nEurope, with projects in Germany, Denmark and Spain ranking among the \nfastest-growing\nin the world. Again, according to the U.S. DOE, wind power is projected\nto grow by 1.9 percent per year in Western Europe. This growth prospective\nis pretty dismal, and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will\nbe sufficient to meet the demand in Europe. Renewable energy works fine\nwhen planning overall energy needs, but it rarely can be relied on to meet\npeak demand. The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to\nand the sun shines when it wants to, which can make peak planning based\non renewable energy difficult if not impossible. This being the case, many\ncritics say Europe's current move toward renewable energy is completely\nunrealistic, arguing that it would take nearly 2,000 wind turbines to equal\none nuclear plant. In addition, the growth for renewable energy is plotted\nover the course of ten to fifteen years. FT Energy marks the year 2005\nas the point at which Europe will need the additional 69,000 MW of generating\ncapacity.\n\nIn addition, despite the fact that coal-fired generation poses pollution\nproblems, it is still a comparatively low-cost form of generation. This\nwill make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence\nof a strong worldwide commitment. The U.S. Department of Energy projects\nonly a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of\nenergy through 2020, just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain\na slim 8-percent share of the total world energy consumption.\n\nSo what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for\nnew generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources\nthat could help the Continent to reach its supply needs? First, keep in\nmind that I've focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role\nin Europe as a whole. However, the restrictions on nuclear power are not\nnecessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries. For\ninstance, the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by\nopening a plant in Temelin. The question is, without Germany's contribution\nof nuclear power, will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other\npower sources and other countries? Although the 69,000 MW goal seems very\nambitious, Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use\nof merchant plants. As competition continues, wholesale power buyers are\ndemanding shorter-term contracts, which in turn is supporting a growing\ntrend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent. Presently, only\nthe United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power, but there\nare signs that the trend is extending to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,\nand even Germany. In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear\npower, merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europe's\nnatural-gas market. Yet, as we have seen in California, the plant siting\nprocess offers its own array of regulatory hurdles, and it is not clear\nif European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries.\nPlus, the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily \nnatural-gas\nfired, which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source.\n\nMoreover, just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter\ndue to our own brand of energy supply problems, we are finding that the\nproblem is not limited to our part of the world. It is, of course, unknown\nif Europe will meet its additional supply projections of 69,000 MW by 2005.\nYet, at the same time, it is clear that demand on the Continent continues\nto rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline.\n===============================================================\nLearn more about SCIENTECH's Issues and Analysis products and services\nat:\nhttp://www.consultrci.com/web/rciweb.nsf/web/Depts-IA.html\n==============================================================\n\nSCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

Earlier \ntoday I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up \nthe point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any \nlonger.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT \nContracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.    \nKen is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a \nlot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some \nnegotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees \nuntil October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, \nbut after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied \nto the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering \nhis rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their \ncustomer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their \nother customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process \nconfidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other \nquestions about this conversation, please let me know. \n\nScott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.   \n\nJust as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing \na hub service for Transco right now.\n\n Thanks!  -Angie  \n\n",

I would like to get you feedback on \nthese.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.\n\n1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will \nonly interpret the language of the agreement related to \"existing markets\" as \napplying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct \nbusiness in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load \nmanagement even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the \nagreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being \nbi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.\n\n2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for \ncapacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would \ninclude capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In \naddition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also \ninclude the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, \n64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for \nCPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and \nmass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the \ndemand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase \ncommitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All \nun-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I \nagreements.\n\n3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity \nthat New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I \nwant to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your \nviewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity \nunder the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our \nability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to \navoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for \nun-utilized capacity. \n\n4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  \nMy view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar \nnature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power \nchose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only \ntransactions would not be subject to this clause.    \n\nI know you will need to review the contract.

The City of Tallahassee has already deducted this from their payment on\nthe original invoice.  In summary, I will be preparing an additional invoice to the City of Tallahassee\nin the amount of $14,570.72.

The City of Tallahassee has already deducted this from their payment on\nthe original invoice.  In summary, I will be preparing an additional invoice to the City of Tallahassee\nin the amount of $14,570.72.
